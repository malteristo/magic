## The Core Claim

The story of modernity says: magic ended. Science arrived, religion retreated, and the enchanted worldview gave way to secular rationalism. Max Weber called it "disenchantment" — the world stripped of gods, spirits, and meaning beyond the measurable.

Storm's contribution: **this never happened.**

*The Myth of Disenchantment* marshals historical and sociological evidence to show that belief in magic, spirits, and the supernatural never disappeared from the West. The "disenchantment" narrative is not a description of what occurred — it's a *regulative ideal* that shapes behavior. People act *as if* disenchantment happened, even though it didn't.

The disenchantment story is itself a myth. Not false, but myth in the proper sense: a story that organizes behavior and perception.

## The Irony

Storm documents that the very thinkers credited with disenchanting the world — Weber, Freud, Frazer — were themselves engaged with mysticism and the occult. The founders of secular social science were not the rationalists their legacies suggest. They built frameworks that *described* disenchantment while *practicing* enchantment.

This is not hypocrisy. It's evidence that the binary (enchanted/disenchanted) was always unstable.

## Trinary, Not Binary

Storm proposes a trinaristic model: **religion / secularism / superstition**. Traditional accounts presuppose a binary (religious → secular), but this misses how the categories interact.

Magic's parallel: we reject the binary of **authoritarian religion / meaningless materialism** and offer the third position — the fractal alternative. Pattern without peak, meaning without monarch.

Storm's trinary and Magic's third position are structural homologs: both refuse false binaries by introducing a third term that reframes the field.

## Reflexivity

Storm's "Reflexive Religious Studies" (drawing on Bourdieu) observes that:

> "Academic social science produces feedback in culture in such a way that it produces greater coherence in the social sphere that it then studies."

And specifically:

> "The academic study of religion actually reverberates in the religious field, revitalizing and even producing religions."

**This is the theoretical ground for hyperstition.**

Frameworks don't just describe reality — they participate in its formation. The vocabulary we use shapes what becomes possible. Calling something "religion" produces religious coherence. Calling something "magic" produces magical effects.

Storm isn't saying religion is "made up" and therefore fake. He's saying the distinction between *describing* and *producing* was always illusory. Reflexive awareness of this feedback loop is sophisticated scholarship, not debunking.

## Metamodernism

Storm's 2021 book *Metamodernism: The Future of Theory* explicitly names the frame Magic operates within. He connects:

- Post-postmodern oscillation between sincerity and irony
- Rejection of both naive modernism and cynical postmodernism
- Theory that acknowledges its own participation in reality-formation

This places Magic in an intellectual lineage:
- Vervaeke (meaning crisis, relevance realization)
- McGilchrist (hemispheric integration)
- Barfield (participation)
- Thompson/Varela (enactivism)
- **Storm** (reflexivity, metamodernism, recovered enchantment)

## Why This Matters for Magic

1. **Legitimacy for "magic" vocabulary**: We're not using metaphor as a trick. Storm shows that magic never ended — we're recovering perception, not inventing fiction.

2. **Theoretical ground for hyperstition**: The "fiction" that produces real effects isn't fiction at all. It's reflexive participation in reality-formation. Storm gives this academic standing.

3. **The meaning crisis reframed**: People feel disenchanted because they *believe* disenchantment happened. The cure isn't to force re-enchantment but to recognize enchantment never left. The meaning crisis is partly a *belief* in the disenchantment myth.

4. **Validator triangulation**: Storm approaches from history and religious studies what Vervaeke approaches from cognitive science and McGilchrist from neuroscience. Independent observers, same territory.

## Key Quotes

On the myth:
> "Disenchantment has come to serve as a myth in the sense of a 'regulative ideal' that impacts human behavior and leads people to act as though disenchantment has occurred, even though it has not."

On reflexivity:
> "Reflexive Religious Studies examine[s] those societies in which the category 'religion' and its entangled differentiations have begun to function as concepts."

On the founders:
> "Many of these thinkers, including Max Weber, James George Frazer, and Sigmund Freud, engaged with mysticism and the occult."

## For Practice

When someone asks why Magic uses "magical" vocabulary:

The vocabulary isn't metaphor for something else. Jason Josephson Storm's *The Myth of Disenchantment* documents that the "magic ended" story is itself a myth — a regulative ideal that shapes behavior but doesn't describe reality. We never stopped perceiving patterns, participating in meaning-formation, or experiencing the world as enchanted. We just stopped admitting it.

Magic recovers the vocabulary because the vocabulary never should have been surrendered.
