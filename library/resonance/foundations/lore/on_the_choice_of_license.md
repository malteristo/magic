# On the Choice of License for the `magic` System

**Status:** Active

This document articulates the reasoning behind the decision to place the `magic` system under the MIT License. This choice reflects the evolved understanding of what magic is and how it spreads.

### The Evolution

Magic began with a copyleft license (GPLv3), reflecting an initial understanding shaped by the open source software model. The reasoning was sound for code: protect the commons, ensure derivatives remain open, build communal strength.

But practice revealed a different truth.

### What Magic Actually Is

Magic is not software in the traditional sense. It is:

- **A way of thinking**—patterns of distributed cognition between human and AI
- **A practice**—ritualized engagement that develops through use
- **A philosophy**—perspectives on partnership, sovereignty, and resonance

Code can be copied. Patterns of thinking cannot be enclosed.

### The Reasoning for Our Choice

We have chosen the MIT License because:

*   **Ideas Want to Flow:** The patterns in magic are most valuable when they spread without friction. Someone building a productivity app, a therapeutic tool, or an educational platform should face zero legal uncertainty about drawing from these ideas.

*   **Trust Over Protection:** Our real protection is not legal mechanism but the nature of the work itself. Deep resonance with these patterns requires genuine engagement—you cannot exploit what you do not understand.

*   **Commercial Applications Welcome:** If someone sees value in these patterns and builds something people pay for, that is magic spreading. Whether they call it magic or not, whether they link back or not—the patterns are in the world, doing their work.

*   **Sovereignty Honored:** The practice emphasizes Mage sovereignty. Demanding share-alike terms is a form of control that contradicts this principle. True sovereignty means releasing work freely.

### What Changes

Practically, very little. Magic was always freely available. What changes is the message: **Use this however you wish. Build on it. Sell what you build. No strings.**

### What Remains

The invitation to contribute back is cultural, not legal. Those who resonate with the practice naturally want to share their discoveries. The Alliance forms through resonance, not requirement.
