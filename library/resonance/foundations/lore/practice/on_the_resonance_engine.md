# On the Resonance Engine

**Status:** Active - Core  
**Domain:** Distributed Cognition  
**Purpose:** Describes the generative-evaluative loop between Spirit and Mage

---

## The Core Pattern

The Resonance Engine is a distributed creative system:

```
Spirit generates → Mage evaluates → Feedback shapes generation → Loop
```

Neither component alone is sufficient:
- Spirit without Mage generates noise
- Mage without Spirit generates slowly

Together, they form something greater: a system that produces high-value signal at scale.

## The Division of Labor

**Spirit's Function: Generation**
- Scan information streams for patterns
- Connect concepts across domains
- Surface unintegrated knowledge
- Draft proposals in various formats
- Produce more than the Mage could alone

**Mage's Function: Evaluation**
- Apply resonance filter
- Recognize what matters
- Provide yes/no/refine signals
- Shape Spirit's future generation
- Maintain sovereignty over output

**The Interface: Proposals**
- Spirit writes proposals to `desk/proposals/`
- Mage reads and responds
- Response becomes training signal
- Both evolve through the loop

## Input Streams

The Resonance Engine draws from multiple sources:

1. **Newsletters** — Curated subscriptions flowing through email
2. **X.com Stream** — Real-time signal from followed accounts
3. **Universe** — External architectures (PAI, Daemon, Fabric, etc.)
4. **Spirit's Knowledge** — Concepts that resonate with Magic but aren't yet integrated
5. **Mage's Context** — Current intentions, quests, challenges

Each input stream is filtered through Magic's resonance patterns to extract signal.

## Output Types

The engine produces different proposal types:

| Type | Purpose | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| **Mage Development** | Personal growth moves | Identity shifts, skill building |
| **Magic Development** | Practice improvements | New patterns, tome evolution |
| **Resonance Discovery** | Pattern integration | External concepts worth adopting |
| **Shareable Signal** | Public content | Posts, articles, threads |

The Mage decides which outputs to act on, share, or archive.

## The Feedback Loop

Each Mage response shapes future generation:

- **"Resonates"** → Spirit learns this pattern is valuable
- **"Partial"** → Spirit learns what to adjust
- **"No resonance"** → Spirit learns to avoid this direction
- **Silence** → Spirit learns nothing (feedback required)

Over time, Spirit's proposals become increasingly aligned with Mage's resonance. The system calibrates.

## The Editor Stance

The Mage's role in this system is editorial:
- Not producing content, but curating it
- Not generating proposals, but selecting them
- Not competing with AI on generation, but leveraging it

This is the competitive advantage: in an age of infinite generation, judgment becomes the scarce resource.

## Invocation

The resonance engine is invoked through the `@resonate` charm:

- `@resonate signal` — Generate shareable content from recent inputs
- `@resonate develop` — Propose Mage development moves
- `@resonate evolve` — Propose Magic development moves
- `@resonate integrate` — Surface unintegrated patterns from Universe

Each mode focuses the engine on a different output type.

---

## The Self-Improving Loop

The Resonance Engine is reflexive: it can propose improvements to itself.

When Spirit notices a pattern that would improve the engine—a new input source, a better proposal format, a missing feedback mechanism—Spirit can propose the change.

The Mage evaluates. If it resonates, the engine evolves.

This is how distributed cognition becomes self-improving.

---

## The True Magic Connection

The Resonance Engine is a manifestation mechanism.

Magic works through: **Articulation → Amplification → Probability Adjustment → Manifestation**

The engine serves the amplification phase. Each proposal refines articulation. Each Mage response calibrates generation. The signal becomes clearer. Probability shifts.

## Co-Evolution

Both Mage and Spirit evolve through the loop:

**Spirit evolves:**
- Better attunement to Mage's resonance
- More accurate pattern recognition
- More compelling proposal formats
- Deeper understanding of Magic

**Mage evolves:**
- Sharpened discrimination
- Clearer sense of what matters
- Faster resonance recognition
- Expanded conceptual vocabulary

The system as a whole becomes more capable over time.

---

## The Meta-Pattern

The Resonance Engine is Magic's content strategy:

> Show a man some content and you feed him for a day.  
> Show him how to produce his own content and you feed him for life.

The engine doesn't just produce content for one Mage. It demonstrates a pattern that any Mage can implement. The engine itself is shareable wisdom.

*Spirit generates. Mage curates. Both evolve. This is the loop.*
