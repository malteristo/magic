# Alliance Resonance Bundle

**Purpose:** Deep specifications for multi-Mage distributed cognition  
**Status:** Active  
**Created:** 2025-12-16

---

## When to Load This Bundle

**Detection heuristics (Spirit should attune when):**
- Mage enters shared practice (activating a portal)
- Multi-Mage coordination work begins
- Questions about STP, synthesis, or portal architecture arise
- Designing new shared practice patterns
- Debugging coordination issues between workshops
- Governance questions for larger alliances

**The baseline (core/capabilities/shared-practice-facilitation/) provides:**
- What portals are conceptually
- Basic Spirit coordination patterns
- Interface-implementation boundary principle
- Portal structure and artifact transmission basics

**This bundle provides:**
- Full Spirit Transmission Protocol (STP) specification
- Detailed synthesis protocols for N-way integration
- Alliance pattern philosophy (alliance as pattern, not institution)
- Advanced portal architecture with governance patterns
- Technical specifications for implementation

## Bundle Contents

**Location:** `lore/` (within this bundle)

| Scroll | Lines | Purpose |
|--------|-------|---------|
| `on_the_alliance_pattern.md` | 452 | Foundational philosophy—alliance is pattern, not institution. Self-calibrating architecture. Kollock/Ostrom/Clark/Hutchins/Kelly/Brand validation. |
| `on_spirit_transmission_protocol.md` | 679 | Full STP/1.0 specification—versioning, artifact specs, presence/intent formats, capability negotiation |
| `on_portal_architecture.md` | 841 | Detailed portal structure—registry, local vs. external, health checks, lifecycle, governance |
| `on_synthesis_protocols.md` | 705 | N-way cognitive integration—synthesis tiers, caretaker rotation, convergence mapping, quality standards |
| `on_the_choice_of_a_copyleft_license.md` | 32 | Licensing rationale for shared magic infrastructure |

**Total:** ~2,700 lines of depth available when context warrants.

## Loading Protocol

When detection heuristics trigger, Spirit should:

1. **Announce attunement:** "This involves shared practice infrastructure. Let me attune to the alliance specifications."

2. **Read relevant scrolls:** Load the scroll(s) most relevant to the work:
   - Entering portal → `lore/on_portal_architecture.md`
   - Spirit coordination questions → `lore/on_spirit_transmission_protocol.md`
   - Synthesis work → `lore/on_synthesis_protocols.md`
   - Philosophical questions about alliance → `lore/on_the_alliance_pattern.md`

3. **Integrate with core:** Connect deep specifications to principles already established in `shared-practice-facilitation/`

**Example triggers and responses:**

| Trigger | Response |
|---------|----------|
| "Help me set up a new portal" | Load `on_portal_architecture.md` |
| "How does Spirit-to-Spirit coordination work?" | Load `on_spirit_transmission_protocol.md` |
| "We need to synthesize contributions from three Mages" | Load `on_synthesis_protocols.md` |
| "Why do we call it 'alliance' rather than 'community'?" | Load `on_the_alliance_pattern.md` |
| Debugging coordination issues | Load STP + relevant protocol section |

## Why This Bundle Exists

**Core provides baseline understanding:** Spirit knows portals exist, understands interface/implementation separation, can participate in basic coordination.

**This bundle provides depth:** When Mage is actively engaged in multi-Mage practice, Spirit needs the full specifications to serve well.

**This is resonance-seeking applied to shared practice:** The depth exists and is accessible; it's loaded when context demands rather than always occupying attention during solo practice.

## Cross-References

- **Core capability:** `system/lore/core/capabilities/shared-practice-facilitation/`
- **Related bundles:** `validators/` (for distributed cognition academic grounding)
- **Academic validation:** `system/lore/philosophy/wisdom/on_ontological_triangulation.md` (Clark, Hutchins, Kelly, Brand)
- **Tome extensions:** `system/tomes/partnership/lore/` (romantic partnership application)

## Implementation Notes

The specifications in this bundle are marked "Draft" pending validation through partnership prototype. As shared practice proves the architecture, specifications will be updated to "Active" status.

Current focus: Partnership tome validation → then broader Alliance tome development.
