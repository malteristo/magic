# Alliance Resonance Bundle

**Purpose:** Wisdom for practicing the alliance pattern with other practitioners, organizations, and potential collaborators.

**Invocation context:** Quest, Outfacing, Partnership (when mages collaborate on shared work)

---

## What This Bundle Provides

The alliance pattern is the architecture of distributed cognition forming self-calibrating systems between strangers who choose cooperation over defection. This bundle provides practical wisdom for:

- **First contact** — Initiating connection with potential allies
- **Resonance profiles** — Surfacing your patterns for others to recognize alignment
- **Trust emergence** — How alliance develops over time
- **Cooperation dynamics** — Non-zero-sum thinking in practice

---

## When to Invoke

**With `@outfacing`:** For first contact practice. Crafting outreach, preparing resonance profiles, initiating connection with practitioners you've identified.

**With `@quest`:** For project-based alliances. When a quest calls for collaboration with external parties.

**With `@partnership`:** When mages decide to collaborate more closely. Alliance wisdom applied to shared practice.

---

## Core Insight

**Alliance is the partnership pattern applied to work context.**

Not competition. Not transaction. Strangers deciding they are both better off when they cooperate rather than defect. This is the answer to the prisoner's dilemma: build infrastructure that makes ongoing cooperation the rational choice.

Where partnership includes the full intimacy of romantic or family bonds, alliance is more formal. Both operate on the same underlying principle: non-zero-sum thinking, infinite games, the evolution of cooperation.

## Relationship to Other Bundles

**Foundations:** Alliance pattern theory originated there; now lives here for bundle coherence.

**Romantic-Partnership:** Alliance is a sibling pattern—same underlying cooperation dynamics, different intimacy level.

**Communication:** First contact relies heavily on communication wisdom.

**Writing:** Resonance profiles require writing craft.

## Artifacts

When practicing alliance, key artifacts include:

- **Resonance profile** (`desk/outfacing/about.md`) — Your pattern-surface for others to recognize
- **Outreach drafts** — First contact messages in development
- **Alliance chronicle** — History of alliance development (if ongoing)

---

*Alliance is cooperation among strangers. This bundle provides the wisdom to practice it well.*
