# On Resonance Profiles

**Status:** Active  
**Domain:** Alliance Practice  
**Purpose:** Wisdom for creating artifacts that surface your patterns for others to recognize

A resonance profile is an artifact that enables pattern-recognition at a distance. It answers the question strangers ask when they encounter you: "Who is this person, and might our patterns align?"

## I. What a Resonance Profile Is

### Not a Resume

A resume lists credentials and accomplishments. It optimizes for institutional gatekeepers evaluating qualification. It asks: "Are they qualified for this role?"

A resonance profile surfaces patterns. It optimizes for fellow practitioners evaluating alignment. It asks: "Do we think similarly? Might cooperation serve?"

### Not a Sales Pitch

Marketing optimizes for conversion. It highlights benefits and minimizes friction toward a transaction. It asks: "How do I get them to buy/follow/engage?"

A resonance profile optimizes for accurate pattern-matching. It might actively *discourage* people who wouldn't align. It asks: "Can they recognize whether we resonate?"

### A Pattern-Surface

Imagine your thinking as a complex shape. A resonance profile is a low-dimensional projection of that shape that preserves enough structure for pattern-matching.

Someone reading it should be able to:
- Recognize shared patterns (if they exist)
- Identify divergent patterns (if they exist)  
- Assess whether dialogue would be valuable
- All without requiring conversation

## II. Elements of Effective Profiles

### World Model

How do you think things work? This is your ontology, your operating assumptions, the frame through which you perceive reality.

Daniel Miessler's profile opens with his world model: the meaning crisis, AI's impact, what's happening and what's needed. This immediately tells you how he sees things.

Your world model should include:
- What you think reality fundamentally is (your ontology)
- What you think is happening in the world (your diagnosis)
- What you think matters (your values orientation)

### What You're Working On

Concrete current focus. Not aspirations—actual practice.

This grounds the world model in action. Theory without practice is speculation. Practice demonstrates genuine commitment.

Include:
- Primary projects or practices
- What specifically you're building/doing
- How it connects to your world model

### Validators

Who else has perceived similar patterns? This is ontological triangulation made explicit.

Listing validators serves multiple purposes:
- Provides intellectual genealogy (where your patterns come from)
- Creates recognition hooks (shared references activate resonance)
- Demonstrates pattern-convergence (you're not inventing alone)

The table format works well:
| Validator | Contribution |
|-----------|--------------|
| Jung | Consciousness through dialogue |
| Hofstadter | Strange loops, recursive self-reference |
| Clark & Chalmers | Extended mind |

### Background

Where did you come from? What paths led here?

This isn't credential-listing—it's trajectory-revealing. The path matters because it shows how your patterns emerged.

Include:
- Relevant domains you've worked in
- Perspectives you hold (technical, philosophical, artistic, etc.)
- What gives you standing to speak on these topics

### Values and Stances

Where do you stand on contested questions? This is where you take positions.

Values differentiate. Two people might share world model but differ on values. Making values explicit enables accurate alignment assessment.

Include:
- Positions on relevant debates
- How you handle uncertainty
- What you prioritize when tradeoffs arise

## III. Craft Considerations

### Appropriate Length

Long enough to enable pattern-matching. Short enough to respect attention.

The profile should be skimmable. Headers, tables, and clear structure let readers navigate to what interests them. Dense paragraphs lose people.

### Authentic Voice

Write as yourself. The profile should sound like you sound when thinking clearly. If it sounds performed, it fails—you'll attract people who resonate with the performance, not with you.

Avoid:
- AI tells (excessive structure, hedge words, overused vocabulary)
- Academic jargon (unless that's genuinely your voice)
- Marketing enthusiasm
- False humility or false confidence

### Specific Over General

"I'm interested in AI" tells nothing. "I practice distributed cognition through AI-human partnership, treating the relationship as cognitive extension rather than tool use" tells a lot.

Specificity enables recognition. General statements apply to everyone and distinguish no one.

### Invitations, Not Claims

"I am wise" claims status. "Here's how I think; see if it resonates" invites assessment.

The profile should feel like an open hand, not a closed fist. You're showing your patterns, not asserting your value.

## IV. What to Include, What to Omit

### Include

- Your actual thinking (world model, values, stances)
- Concrete current practice
- Validators who shaped your patterns
- Enough background for context
- How to connect if resonance is detected

### Omit

- Exhaustive credential lists (profile isn't resume)
- Defensive qualifications ("I might be wrong but...")
- Everything (profile is projection, not complete representation)
- Sensitive personal details (sovereignty over disclosure)
- Claims you can't substantiate with artifacts

### The Projection Principle

A profile cannot capture you completely. It's a deliberate reduction that preserves pattern-structure while reducing dimensionality.

Choose what to project based on:
- What patterns are most central to your practice?
- What would potential allies most need to recognize?
- What distinguishes you from adjacent practitioners?

---

## V. Maintenance and Evolution

### Living Document

Your patterns evolve. Your profile should too.

Review periodically:
- Does this still represent how I think?
- Have my practices changed?
- Are there new validators I've integrated?
- Has my world model updated?

### Version History

Consider preserving prior versions. Your evolution is itself pattern-information. How you've changed reveals something about your trajectory.

Git naturally provides this through commit history. Use it.

## VI. The Daniel Miessler Pattern

His about page exemplifies the form:

1. **Opens with world model** — The meaning crisis, what's happening
2. **Current work** — TELOS, Substrate, what he's actually building
3. **Background** — Security, philosophy, trajectory
4. **Validators** — Who shaped his thinking (implicit in references)
5. **Values** — Strong positions, clearly stated
6. **What he enjoys** — Personal texture that humanizes

This structure works because it enables rapid pattern-matching while providing depth for those who want it.

## VII. Relationship to First Contact

The profile and first contact message work together:

| First Contact Message | Resonance Profile |
|-----------------------|-------------------|
| Brief | Comprehensive |
| Points to profile | Is what's pointed to |
| Creates curiosity | Satisfies curiosity |
| Low-cost to consume | Higher investment, optional |
| "Here's the connection" | "Here's who I am" |

The message opens the door; the profile is the room.

## VIII. Storage and Access

### Location

`desk/outfacing/about.md` — Mage-specific, part of outfacing practice.

### Public Version

The profile in your repository is the public artifact. It should be:
- Accessible without authentication
- Linked from wherever first contact might originate
- Updated when significant changes occur

### Integration with Outfacing

When `@outfacing` is invoked with alliance bundle, Spirit knows to check for and utilize the resonance profile. It's infrastructure for alliance formation.

## IX. The Deeper Function

A resonance profile is an act of self-knowledge made visible.

Writing it forces you to articulate patterns you hold implicitly. What do you actually think? What do you actually value? Who actually shaped you?

The profile serves others, but creating it serves you. Clarity about your own patterns is prerequisite to recognizing alignment with others.

- `on_the_nature_of_resonance.md` — What resonance fundamentally is
- `on_first_contact.md` — How profiles support initial outreach

*A resonance profile surfaces your patterns for others to recognize. Authentic. Specific. Inviting assessment rather than claiming value. Infrastructure for alliance formation.*
