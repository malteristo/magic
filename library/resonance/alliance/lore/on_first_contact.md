# On First Contact

**Status:** Active  
**Domain:** Alliance Practice  
**Purpose:** Wisdom for initiating connection with potential allies

This scroll addresses the moment before alliance exists: when you've identified someone whose patterns might align with yours, and you choose to reach out. First contact is the practice of creating conditions for resonance to be tested.

## I. The Nature of First Contact

### What You're Actually Doing

First contact is **resonance-seeking between strangers**. You've perceived patterns in another's work that suggest alignment. Now you're creating an opportunity for mutual pattern-recognition.

You are not:
- Selling yourself
- Requesting something from them
- Proving your worth
- Performing competence

You are:
- Surfacing your patterns
- Offering an invitation
- Creating space for them to recognize alignment (or not)
- Beginning the trust-emergence process

### The Asymmetry

In first contact, you typically know more about them than they know about you. You've studied their work; they haven't studied yours. This asymmetry creates responsibility:

**Your job is to reduce the asymmetry efficiently.** Give them enough pattern-surface that they can assess resonance without requiring excessive investment.

This is why resonance profiles exist. The about page, the repository, the public artifacts—these let strangers assess alignment before committing to dialogue.

## II. What Makes First Contact Work

### Signal Clarity

The message must answer quickly:
- Who is this person?
- Why are they reaching out to me specifically?
- What are they offering/proposing?
- What would engaging cost me?

Unclear signals get ignored. Not from rudeness, but from cognitive load. People with valuable patterns receive many messages. Yours must be legible at a glance.

### Pattern Recognition Hooks

Include elements that activate recognition in someone already attuned to similar patterns:

- Shared vocabulary (if you genuinely share it)
- Specific references to their work (showing you've actually engaged)
- Your own work as evidence (not claims, artifacts)
- The frame you're operating from (so they can assess fit)

### Respect for Sovereignty

First contact is an invitation, not a claim on their attention. The message should:
- Be complete without requiring response
- Make declining easy (no guilt, no obligation)
- Provide value even if they never respond (point them to something useful)
- Honor their time constraints

### Authentic Voice

Don't perform. If you're genuinely aligned, your natural expression will contain the patterns they recognize. If you're not aligned, performing won't help—you'd be initiating a false alliance.

Write as yourself. Let resonance or its absence emerge naturally.

## III. The Structure of First Contact

### The Opening

Establish context immediately. Who are you in relation to them?

**Weak:** "Hi, I'm [name], I'm really interested in your work."  
**Stronger:** "I've been building [thing] based on principles that overlap with your [specific work]."

The strong version:
- Shows you've engaged with their work specifically
- Positions you as practitioner, not admirer
- Creates immediate context for why you're reaching out

### The Bridge

What connects your work to theirs? This is where you surface the pattern overlap.

Be specific. Not "we're both interested in AI" but "your framing of [X] addresses the same problem I've been approaching through [Y]."

The bridge should make them curious about your approach—not because you've claimed it's good, but because you've described it precisely enough that they can assess whether the pattern is interesting.

### The Invitation

What are you proposing? This should be:
- Specific enough to be actionable
- Low-cost enough to be reasonable
- Genuine (something you actually want)

Examples:
- "I'd welcome your perspective on [specific thing]"
- "If this resonates, I'd be interested in exploring collaboration on [domain]"
- "I've written my own version of [thing you do]; happy to share if useful"

### The Release

Make it easy to not respond. This isn't false humility—it's genuine respect for their constraints.

"No obligation to respond—I mainly wanted to surface the connection."

This releases pressure and paradoxically makes response more likely. People respond when they want to, not when they feel obligated.

## IV. Common Failure Modes

### Over-Explaining

The impulse to prove yourself leads to walls of text. Resist. First contact should be brief. If they want depth, they can explore your artifacts.

### Under-Explaining

The opposite failure: so brief that there's nothing to recognize. "Hey, love your work, let's connect" provides no pattern-surface.

### Performing Alignment

Mirroring their vocabulary without genuine understanding. This fails quickly if dialogue begins. Worse, it initiates alliance on false pretenses.

### Requesting Too Much

Asking for significant time investment in first contact. Meetings, calls, detailed feedback—these are second-contact activities. First contact establishes whether there's resonance worth investing in.

### Generic Outreach

Messages that could be sent to anyone. These signal you haven't actually engaged with their specific work. Specificity demonstrates genuine attention.

## V. After First Contact

### If They Respond

Resonance detected. Now you're in dialogue. The alliance pattern begins to operate: you're testing whether cooperation produces more than either alone.

Move at appropriate pace. Don't rush to deep collaboration. Let trust emerge through exchange.

### If They Don't Respond

This is information, not failure. Possible meanings:
- They're overwhelmed (common for people with valuable patterns)
- The timing is wrong
- The resonance isn't there (on their end)
- The message didn't land (your execution)

Don't interpret silence as rejection. Don't follow up repeatedly. If there's future opportunity for natural connection, take it. Otherwise, move on. The alliance pattern doesn't require any specific alliance to form.

### The Long Game

First contact plants seeds. Sometimes they germinate immediately. Sometimes years later. Sometimes never.

Your job is to surface genuine patterns and create genuine invitations. Their job is to respond according to their own situation and judgment. Both are doing their part correctly when they act authentically.

## VI. Relationship to Resonance Profiles

First contact works best when supported by a resonance profile. The message itself is brief; the profile provides depth for those who want to explore.

The pattern:
1. First contact message surfaces connection and points to profile
2. Interested recipient explores profile at their own pace
3. Profile enables pattern-recognition without dialogue cost
4. Dialogue (if it happens) begins from shared understanding

This is why `desk/outfacing/about.md` matters. It's not vanity—it's infrastructure for alliance formation.

## VII. The Deeper Recognition

First contact is an act of faith in the alliance pattern itself. You're betting that:
- Genuine pattern alignment produces value
- Surfacing your patterns honestly is better than performing
- The right alliances will form; the wrong ones won't
- Your job is to create conditions, not force outcomes

This is wu wei applied to alliance. You do your part (surface patterns, extend invitation) and release attachment to results. What serves will emerge.
