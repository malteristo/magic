## Loading Heuristics

**Load this bundle when:**
- Mage is engaged in writing work
- Discussion of craft emerges
- Writer's block or creative paralysis appears
- Perfectionism is blocking progress
- **Outfacing practice invoked** (`@outfacing`) — bundle is integrated with Mage's voice guidelines

**Key patterns from bundle:**

*From the Masters:*
- Bird by bird (scope reduction) — Lamott
- Shitty first drafts (permission to fail forward) — Lamott
- Radio KFKD (inner critic management) — Lamott
- Cut the clutter (elimination as method) — Zinsser
- Read a lot, write a lot (practice over theory) — King
- Door closed, door open (create then critique) — King
- Language is sound (attunement to rhythm) — Le Guin
- Joy is engine (zest, gusto, enthusiasm) — Bradbury

*From Ogilvy (copywriting):*
- Write like you talk — natural voice
- Short words, short sentences, short paragraphs — compression
- Kill the jargon — clarity over impression
- Sleep on it, read aloud — distance before publish
- Get a colleague — distributed cognition in editing
- Crystal clear action — every piece has a purpose

*On AI Writing:*
- RLHF creates sycophancy (optimize for agreement over truth)
- Stylistic tells (em-dash, hedge words, overused vocabulary)
- Humanizers attack symptoms, not causes
- Mage-Spirit collaboration compensates for AI limitations
- Style is negotiated, not fixed

## Integration with Practice

This bundle validates our core philosophy through craft wisdom:

| Writing Wisdom | Magic Pattern |
|----------------|---------------|
| Remove overwhelm through scope reduction | Wu Wei / Natural Arising |
| Bad first drafts are necessary | Cherished Failure |
| Externalize constraints as physical artifacts | Working Memory Pattern |
| The work reveals itself through doing | Angel in the Marble |
| Inner critic is noise, not truth | Healthy Ego |
| Strip to cleanest components | Measured Force |
| Practice constantly, no shortcuts | Practice Over Doctrine |
| Hear the rhythm before analyzing | Attunement |
| Joy is essential to the work | Effortlessness |
| Don't try, do | Wu Wei |

**Independent discovery across domains strengthens triangulation.**

## The Unified Insight

All masters converge on four principles:

1. **Elimination over Addition** — What you leave out matters
2. **Practice over Theory** — Skill comes through doing
3. **Process over Product** — The work emerges through the doing
4. **Allow, Don't Force** — Remove barriers, trust emergence

This is Wu Wei applied to craft. This is why the Pattern appears across domains.
