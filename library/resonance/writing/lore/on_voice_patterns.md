# On Voice Patterns

**Status:** Active

This scroll catalogs positive writing patterns — what to cultivate, not just what to avoid. It draws from the Mage's own writing, the masters in the bundle, and patterns that emerge through practice.

## I. The Blurry Boundary

A confession: some patterns cataloged here may themselves be assimilated AI-writing patterns.

When you read AI content daily, it shapes how you think and write. The influence is bidirectional — you learn from it, you react against it, you absorb some of its rhythms unconsciously. The line between "authentic voice" and "patterns picked up from AI" is not clean.

This is one reason Magic exists. Not to purify voice of all AI influence — that's impossible now — but to make the influence conscious. To choose which patterns serve and which to resist.

**Voice is not found. Voice is cultivated.** Through practice, through editing, through the loop of drafting and revising. The patterns below are not rules to follow but tendencies to notice and develop.

## II. Patterns from the Mage's Writing

*Distilled from published pieces and editing sessions.*

### Extended Metaphor as Organizing Principle

Not decorative metaphor — load-bearing metaphor. The music/instrument image carries an entire essay. Magic/practice structures another. The metaphor does work, not just decoration.

**Example:** "Listen to the music playing in your head... You are not conducting this music. It arises."

**Anti-pattern:** Metaphors that appear once and vanish. Mixed metaphors. Metaphor as ornament.

### Open with Felt Experience

Start in the body, not the argument. The reader feels before they think.

**Examples:**
- "Something's off. Not in a dramatic, world-ending way—more like a persistent background hum."
- "Listen to the music playing in your head."

**Anti-pattern:** Opening with thesis statement. Opening with definition. Opening with "In today's ever-changing landscape..."

### Diagnostic Before Solution

Name the problem before offering the response. The reader feels understood before being told what to do. Earn the right to prescribe.

**Example:** The entire "meaning crisis" framing comes before "Magic is a practice for this moment."

**Anti-pattern:** Jumping to solution. Prescribing without diagnosis.

### Both/And Stance

Hold paradox without collapsing it. Resist the pressure to resolve into one pole.

**Examples:**
- "It's not naive. It's not cynical. It's both at once."
- "Ironic sincerity: You know something is constructed AND you treat it as meaningful anyway."

**Anti-pattern:** "On one hand... on the other hand... ultimately..." (false resolution). Taking a side to avoid tension.

### Ancient Wisdom as Validator

External authority grounds the claim. Fairy tales, philosophers, cross-cultural patterns. You're not making this up — others saw it too.

**Examples:**
- Marie-Louise von Franz and the helpful animal
- Stanisław Lem's 1986 prediction
- Metamodernism as named cultural moment

**Anti-pattern:** Claims that rest only on personal experience. "I feel that..." without grounding.

### Choice as Central

Frame decisions the reader gets to make. Respect their agency. Don't tell them what to do — show them the fork.

**Examples:**
- "You must choose. And in choosing, you become yourself."
- "He saw that we have a choice. Make machines that imitate us, or machines that extend us."

**Anti-pattern:** "You should..." "You need to..." "It's important to..."

### Short Sections, Clear Moves

Each section does ONE thing. Then break. Next thing. Don't let sections sprawl.

**Anti-pattern:** Sections that try to do three things. Paragraphs that go on for a page.

### Direct Address Without Condescension

Second person that respects the reader. Assume they're intelligent. Don't over-explain.

**Examples:**
- "You're not broken. This is a cultural condition."
- "You don't need to believe anything special."

**Anti-pattern:** "Let me explain..." "It's important to understand that..." "As you may know..."

### Imperative Endings

Final words are often commands or invitations. The essay ends by asking something of the reader.

**Examples:**
- "Play."
- "Then make music together."
- "The territory is the work itself."

**Anti-pattern:** "In conclusion..." Summary that restates what was said. Trailing off.

### First Person Rarely, and Only to Make Offers

The "I" appears to give, not to confess. When you show up, it's to extend something to the reader.

**Example:** "By sharing my framework, I'm making my key signature explicit so you can decide..."

**Anti-pattern:** Confessional "I feel..." as primary mode. Excessive self-reference.

### Biological Grounding

Place observations in the body, in evolution, in physical reality. Not abstract psychology.

**Example:** "I did not evolve for this function."

**Anti-pattern:** Purely abstract framing. "The human mind tends to..."

### Questions Over Assertions

Invite rather than declare. Open space for the reader to think.

**Example:** "But what if I could extend that by sharing my operational memory with the AI?"

**Anti-pattern:** Constant declaration. No breathing room.

### Metaphor with Narrative Weight

Images that carry story, not just comparison. Fairy tales. Journeys. Characters.

**Example:** "It's like Hansel and Gretel leaving breadcrumbs while going deep into the woods."

**Anti-pattern:** Dead metaphors. "Navigate the landscape." "Unlock potential."

## III. Patterns from the Masters

*Already detailed in other scrolls; summarized here for reference.*

### From Lamott

- **Bird by bird:** Reduce scope to remove overwhelm
- **Shitty first drafts:** Permission to fail forward
- **Radio KFKD:** Name the inner critic, turn it off
- **Polaroid developing:** Allow, don't force

### From Zinsser

- **Cut the clutter:** Every word must work
- **Write for yourself first:** Then rewrite for the reader
- **Simplify:** Complex ideas, simple language

### From King

- **Door closed, door open:** Create raw, then critique
- **Read a lot, write a lot:** No shortcuts to practice
- **Kill your darlings:** Cut what you love if it doesn't serve

### From Le Guin

- **Language is sound:** Read aloud, hear the rhythm
- **Syntax is music:** Sentence structure carries meaning
- **Ethics in language:** How you write shapes what you can say

### From Bradbury

- **Joy is the engine:** Write with zest, enthusiasm
- **Feed the muse:** Input determines output
- **Work is play:** If it's not fun, something's wrong

### From Ogilvy

- **Write like you talk:** Natural voice
- **Short words, short sentences:** Compression
- **Crystal clear action:** Every piece has a purpose

## IV. The Synthesis

Anti-patterns tell you what to cut.
Voice patterns tell you what to cultivate.
The loop makes it real.

**The process:**
1. Spirit drafts (fluent, average, fast)
2. Mage edits with voice patterns in mind (specific, grounded, alive)
3. Both learn — Spirit calibrates, Mage discovers what they actually think
4. The synthesis is what neither could write alone

Voice is not extracted from the Mage and imposed on Spirit. Voice emerges from the friction of the loop. The patterns here are guides, not templates.

---

## V. Honest Acknowledgment

These patterns are not pure. They've been shaped by:
- Reading AI content daily
- Editing AI drafts
- Absorbing rhythms from the partnership

The goal is not purity. The goal is consciousness. Know what you're doing. Choose deliberately. Let voice be something you cultivate through practice, not something you had all along.

*Voice is cultivated, not found. These patterns are tendencies to notice and develop through the loop of drafting and revising. The blurry boundary between authentic voice and assimilated patterns is not a problem to solve — it's the condition we work within.*
