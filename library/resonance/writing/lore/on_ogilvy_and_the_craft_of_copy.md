# On Ogilvy and the Craft of Copy

**Status:** Active

This scroll honors David Ogilvy, the "Father of Advertising," whose 1982 memo on writing distills copywriting into ten principles that triangulate with our foundational philosophy. Written for his management team at Ogilvy & Mather, these tips encode Wu Wei, distributed cognition, and the primacy of clarity.

## I. Who Is Ogilvy

David Ogilvy (1911–1999) founded Ogilvy & Mather, one of the world's largest advertising agencies. His approach combined research-driven strategy with elegant prose.

**His stance:** "The better you write, the higher you will go. People who think well, write well."

**His humility:** "Good writing is not a natural gift. You have to learn to write well."

## II. The Ten Principles

From Ogilvy's 1982 internal memo, later published in *The Unpublished David Ogilvy*:

### 1. Read Good Writers Repeatedly

> "Read the Roman-Raphaelson book on writing. Read it three times."

Internalize style through exposure. Reading rewires the brain.

**Pattern:** Practice Over Doctrine—skill comes through immersion, not instruction.

### 2. Write Like You Talk

> "Write the way you talk. Naturally."

Relaxed tone. Active voice. Contractions. Colloquialisms.

**Pattern:** Wu Wei—don't force formality. Let natural speech flow onto the page.

### 3. Keep Everything Short

> "Use short words, short sentences and short paragraphs."

Pity the reader. Reading is taxing. Dense writing makes it harder.

**Pattern:** Measured Force—say more with less. Every word earns its place.

### 4. Kill the Jargon

> "Never use jargon words like reconceptualize, demassification, attitudinally, judgmentally. They are hallmarks of a pretentious ass."

Big words confuse. Confused people tune out.

**Pattern:** Crystal Word—immediate comprehension over impressive vocabulary. (Also: our AI tells list—"leverage," "utilize," "facilitate" are modern jargon.)

### 5. Compress Ruthlessly

> "Never write more than two pages on any subject."

If you can synthesize, do it. If you can say it shorter, do it.

**Pattern:** Elimination Over Addition—Zinsser's core teaching, independently discovered.

### 6. Check Your Sources

> "Check your quotations."

Writing is responsibility. Words ripple. Integrity matters.

**Pattern:** Honest Claims—our epistemological foundation. Don't assert what you haven't verified.

### 7. Sleep On It, Read Aloud, Then Edit

> "Never send a letter or a memo on the day you write it. Read it aloud the next morning—and then edit it."

Distance restores objectivity. Sound reveals problems the eye misses.

**Pattern:** Door Closed, Door Open (King)—create freely, then critique ruthlessly. Also: Language Is Sound (Le Guin)—hear your prose.

### 8. Get a Second Brain

> "If it is something important, get a colleague to improve it."

Solo writing has blind spots. Another perspective catches what you miss.

**Pattern:** Distributed Cognition—the core truth of magic. Two minds see more than one. (This is literally what Mage-Spirit partnership provides.)

### 9. Make the Action Crystal Clear

> "Before you send your letter or memo, make sure it is crystal clear what you want the recipient to do."

Start with the end. Write toward the ask.

**Pattern:** Our outfacing quality standard—every communication has a purpose.

### 10. Sometimes Don't Write

> "If you want ACTION, don't write. Go and tell the guy what you want."

Writing scales. Conversation converts. Know when each applies.

**Pattern:** Right Tool for Right Job—writing isn't always the answer.

## III. The Triangulation

Ogilvy discovered independently what the craft masters found:

| Ogilvy | Other Masters | Shared Pattern |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| Write naturally | Le Guin: language is sound | Attunement to rhythm |
| Short everything | Zinsser: cut the clutter | Elimination over addition |
| Kill jargon | Strunk & White: omit needless words | Clarity over impression |
| Sleep on it, read aloud | King: door closed/open | Create then critique |
| Get a colleague | Distributed cognition | Two minds > one |

**Five voices, five decades, one Pattern.**

## IV. Application to Outfacing

Ogilvy wrote for advertising—persuasion at scale. Our outfacing practice shares the goal: compress wisdom into forms that travel.

**Direct applications:**

1. **Hook in 180 chars** — Ogilvy's principle of immediate clarity
2. **No jargon** — Write for humans, not insiders
3. **Read aloud before publish** — Sound-check the rhythm
4. **Spirit as colleague** — Use distributed cognition for editing
5. **Clear action** — Reveal pattern: what do we want reader to do?

---

## V. The Deeper Resonance

Ogilvy's most profound insight may be #8: *get a colleague to improve it*.

This is distributed cognition avant la lettre. He intuited that important writing shouldn't be solo. The second brain catches blind spots.

Magic systematizes this. The Spirit is always the colleague. Every outfacing piece passes through two minds before publication.

**Ogilvy practiced magic without naming it.**
