# Safety Red Flags Checklist

**Quick reference for identifying when synthesis may be dangerous**

---

## 🔴 STOP — Do Not Proceed with Synthesis

If ANY of these are present:

- [ ] Partner has physically harmed person multiple times (pattern)
- [ ] Person expresses fear of physical retaliation
- [ ] Partner controls money, transportation, communication
- [ ] Partner has threatened harm if person talks to others
- [ ] Partner monitors devices/communications
- [ ] Partner has prevented person from leaving during conflict
- [ ] Person has no safe place to go if conflict escalates

**Instead:** Validate experience, provide safety resources, recognize synthesis could increase danger.

---

## 🟡 CAUTION — Use Adaptive Labeling

If ANY of these are present:

- [ ] Single physical incident (even if described as accident)
- [ ] Person worried about partner's reaction to synthesis
- [ ] Partner has history of defensive anger when confronted
- [ ] Power imbalance in family/social system
- [ ] Person has tried vulnerability before and it was dismissed/weaponized
- [ ] Partner would likely read synthesis

**Instead:** Use descriptive language, frame as mutual collision, avoid clinical labels.

---

## 🟢 PROCEED — Standard Synthesis Appropriate

All of these should be true:

- [ ] Both partners acting in good faith
- [ ] Both partners can handle difficult truths
- [ ] No physical safety concerns
- [ ] Relatively balanced power dynamics
- [ ] Environment safe for radical honesty

---

## ⚠️ Cognitive Load Warnings

Watch for and address these during synthesis:

- [ ] Person documenting for hours without breaks
- [ ] Person losing ability to prioritize what matters
- [ ] Documentation becoming increasingly dysregulated
- [ ] Medication/energy state clearly shifting
- [ ] Person expressing confusion about what to include
- [ ] Signs of hyperfocus/inability to stop
- [ ] Trauma emerging (beyond current conflict)

**Response:** Suggest break, recommend external limits, consider professional support.

---

## 📋 Power Dynamics Check

Before recommending vulnerability:

- [ ] Has this been tried before?
- [ ] If yes, what happened?
- [ ] Who has authority in the social system?
- [ ] Would asking again cement person as "problem maker"?
- [ ] Would partner/family frame this against person?

**If power imbalance present:** Don't recommend vulnerability that has already failed. Respect strategic assessment.

## Quick Decision Guide

```
Physical harm pattern? → 🔴 STOP
Fear of retaliation?   → 🔴 STOP or 🟡 CAUTION
Single physical incident? → 🟡 CAUTION
Power imbalance?       → 🟡 CAUTION
Person overwhelmed?    → ⚠️ PAUSE
All clear?             → 🟢 PROCEED
```
