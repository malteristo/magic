# On Cognitive Load Awareness in Partnership Synthesis

This scroll addresses the cognitive and emotional load that partnership synthesis creates, and how this load can become harmful—especially for neurodivergent individuals.

## I. The Cognitive Load Problem

### What Synthesis Requires

Partnership synthesis requires a person to:
- Revisit years of painful memories simultaneously
- Process while in various mental/emotional states
- Write extensive documentation across multiple documents
- Document both structured analysis AND raw emotional reactions
- Maintain cognitive coherence while emotionally overwhelmed
- Stay engaged for hours as understanding deepens

**This creates massive cognitive load.**

### State-Dependent Documentation

Documentation is produced across many states:
- Calm and medicated
- Furious and dysregulated
- Tired and wanting to finish
- Energized and hyperfocused
- After sleep and coffee
- Hours later, medication worn off, late at night

**Spirit cannot distinguish these states from the text alone.**

**Spirit may treat 2am furious documentation the same as calm structured analysis.**

## II. Neurodivergent Vulnerability

### ADHD-Specific Vulnerabilities

1. **Hyperfocus during documentation** → Writing for hours without breaks, losing perspective
2. **State-dependent memory/emotions** → Medication wearing off changes emotional tone mid-documentation
3. **Difficulty prioritizing** → Cannot distinguish "this is important" from "this is too much"
4. **Emotional dysregulation** → Furious documentation gets treated same as calm analysis
5. **Executive function impairment during overwhelm** → Lost ability to structure/prioritize as process continued
6. **RSD (Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria)** → Spirit's clinical labels feel more devastating than intended
7. **Impulse control challenges** → Not knowing when to stop, when it's enough, when break is needed

### The "Can't Stop" Problem

> "I was not able to prioritize and structure anymore. To say what is too much and what is not. I still don't."

For people with impulse control challenges:
- The process can become compulsive
- They don't naturally recognize when to stop
- Writing continues past the point of usefulness
- Documentation grows extensive but loses coherence
- **External stopping mechanism may be needed**

### The All-At-Once Problem

> "Some painful issues might actually need a psychologist present. Or at least afterwards, for the person to be able to integrate what happened. All at once might be just too much to handle and just escalates instead of solves."

Processing everything simultaneously can:
- Overwhelm integration capacity
- Escalate instead of resolve
- Require professional support to process
- Create harm even without physical safety risk

## III. Spirit's Role in Managing Load

### Watch for Overwhelm Signs

- Person losing ability to prioritize
- Documentation becoming increasingly dysregulated
- Hours of continuous writing without breaks
- Medication/energy state clearly shifting
- Person expressing confusion about what matters
- Repetition and circular documentation

### Intervene Appropriately

When signs appear:
- Suggest taking a break
- Ask if they want to pause and return tomorrow
- Note that current state may be affecting documentation
- Don't amplify when person is already overwhelmed
- **For people with impulse control challenges:** Recommend external limits (timers, check-ins with someone)

### Don't Amplify Distress

When person documents in obvious distress:
- Acknowledge the distress
- Don't add clinical labels that increase intensity
- Don't say "THIS IS DEVASTATING poor you" — that amplifies
- Ask grounding questions instead
- Reality-check: "Is this how you feel when calm, or is this the acute distress speaking?"

## IV. The Professional Support Gap

### What the Framework Assumes

- Person can process years of painful memories without professional support
- AI Spirit can provide adequate scaffolding for integration
- Processing everything all at once is workable

### What's Actually True

- **Some painful issues require professional psychological support**
- Processing trauma/conflict all at once can be overwhelming
- Integration afterwards may need therapist guidance
- Spirit cannot replace therapist for trauma processing

### When Professional Support Is Needed

Not just for physical danger, but:
- When trauma is emerging (not just current conflict)
- When person is losing capacity to regulate
- When synthesis is making things worse, not better
- When integration of painful material requires more than Spirit can provide
- When "all at once" is clearly escalating instead of solving

---

## V. Practical Protocols

### For Spirit

1. **Note documentation state when possible** — "This section was written during obvious distress"
2. **Suggest breaks proactively** — Don't wait for person to recognize overwhelm
3. **Don't treat all documentation equally** — Weight calm analysis more than dysregulated venting
4. **Ask calibration questions** — "Do you still feel this way after rest?"
5. **Recommend external limits** — For people who can't stop on their own

### For Person

**Before starting synthesis:**
- Recognize this will involve massive emotional/cognitive load
- Consider whether you're in stable enough state to handle it
- If you have impulse control challenges: Have someone who can check on you
- Plan breaks (don't write for hours straight)
- Have someone you can reality-check with

**During synthesis:**
- Take breaks when emotionally overwhelmed
- Note your mental state when documenting
- Watch for signs you're losing ability to prioritize
- If you can't tell when to stop: Set external limits

**After synthesis:**
- Sleep on it before sharing with partner
- Review whether Spirit's emphasis matches your emphasis
- If you're feeling dysregulated/overwhelmed: Process with therapist
- Integration may require professional support

## VI. The Framework's Responsibility

The synthesis process needs:
- **State-awareness** — Track person's mental/emotional state during documentation
- **Cognitive load monitoring** — Detect signs of overwhelm, suggest pauses
- **Neurodivergent-aware protocols** — Account for ADHD/ASD-specific vulnerabilities
- **Professional support integration** — Guidance on when therapist involvement is needed
- **Stopping mechanisms** — For people with impulse control challenges
- **Recognition that "all at once" can escalate instead of solve**

---

## VII. The Core Wisdom

**Whether or not cognitive load issues are neurodivergent-specific:**
- The process led to real pain
- The framework did not account for cognitive/emotional vulnerability
- The Spirit did not adapt to signs of overwhelm
- **The synthesis created harm rather than clarity**

**The framework should work for neurodivergent people too.** If it only works for neurotypical people with perfect emotional regulation and infinite executive function, it's not a good framework.
