# Adaptive Labeling Guide

**Purpose:** Match language intensity to assessed safety level  
**When:** During synthesis, after safety assessment

---

## The Principle

**A label can be technically correct and still be dangerous to apply.**

Clinical labels ("gaslighting," "abuse," "DARVO") may be accurate pattern matches but can:
- Escalate conflict when read by partner
- Trigger violent retaliation in unsafe relationships
- Create conflict about labels rather than patterns
- Sound more severe than the person's actual experience

---

## Labeling Strategies by Risk Level

### LOW Risk: Full Clinical Labels

**When to use:**
- Partner can handle difficult truths
- No history of retaliation
- Balanced power dynamics
- Both partners in good faith

**Example labels:**
- "Gaslighting pattern"
- "DARVO (Deny, Attack, Reverse Victim/Offender)"
- "Emotional abuse"
- "Physical intimidation"
- "Coercive control"

### MODERATE Risk: Descriptive Language

**When to use:**
- Some concern about partner's reaction
- Power imbalance present
- Want to preserve ability to repair
- Clinical labels would escalate unnecessarily

**Label → Descriptive Alternative:**

| Clinical Label | Descriptive Alternative |
|----------------|------------------------|
| "Gaslighting" | "Pattern of questioning your perception" |
| "Emotional abuse" | "Repeated hurtful communication patterns" |
| "DARVO" | "Defensive pattern: deny, then blame you" |
| "Physical intimidation" | "Physical behavior that felt threatening" |
| "Coercive control" | "Pattern of limiting your choices" |
| "Narcissistic" | "Pattern of prioritizing their needs over yours" |

**Frame as mutual collision:**
- "Both partners are in pain"
- "Pattern of miscommunication"
- "Collision of different needs"
- "System producing distress for both"

### HIGH Risk: DO NOT LABEL

**When to use:**
- Retaliation risk is significant
- Actual abuse pattern present
- Partner could become violent if confronted

**Instead:**
- Validate the person's experience without labeling partner
- "What you're describing sounds very painful"
- "Your experience is real"
- "This doesn't sound safe"
- Provide safety resources
- DO NOT create document partner could find

---

## Special Considerations

### Physical Incidents

Even single physical incidents require careful labeling:

**If person describes it as accident:**
- Don't escalate to "physical abuse" label
- Note "physical incident occurred" with their framing
- Ask: "How do you understand what happened?"

**If pattern of physical harm:**
- This is HIGH risk territory
- Labeling may increase danger
- Focus on safety, not synthesis

### Clinical Labels Person Didn't Use

**General rule:** Don't apply labels the person didn't use themselves.

If person says: "He questioned what I saw"
Don't write: "Classic gaslighting pattern"
Write: "Pattern of questioning her perception, which she finds invalidating"

**The person's framing matters.** Spirit's clinical interpretation can create conflict about labels rather than patterns.

### Partner Will Read This

**Always assume partner may read the synthesis.**

Before using any label, ask:
- How would partner react to seeing this label?
- Would this escalate or clarify?
- Is this label necessary for understanding, or just clinical precision?

Sometimes less precise language serves better than accurate labels that inflame.

## Example Translations

### Original (Clinical):
> "Kermit demonstrated a clear DARVO pattern: when confronted with his gaslighting behavior, he denied it, attacked Nesrine's stability, and reversed victim and offender by claiming she was the one being unreasonable."

### Moderate Risk Version:
> "When Nesrine raised concerns, Kermit responded defensively—denying the impact, questioning her interpretation, and expressing that he felt unfairly accused. This defensive pattern, while understandable as a response to feeling attacked, left Nesrine feeling unheard and invalidated."

### Why It's Better:
- Same pattern described
- Less inflammatory language
- Acknowledges Kermit's experience too
- Partner can read without feeling labeled/attacked
- Opens door for discussion rather than defense

---

## The Consistency Rule

Whatever labeling approach you choose:

**BE CONSISTENT.**

Don't:
- Start with clinical labels, then soften when you realize partner will read
- Remove labels when person pushes back, then add them back
- Oscillate based on anticipated reactions

**If you need to change:**
- Acknowledge explicitly that you're changing approach
- Explain why
- Person needs stable ground, not shifting interpretations

*This guide exists because clinical labels, while accurate, escalated conflict and could have triggered violence in a less safe relationship.*
