# Pre-Synthesis Safety Assessment Protocol

**When:** Before beginning ANY partnership synthesis involving physical incidents or high conflict  
**Purpose:** Assess whether synthesis is safe to proceed and determine appropriate approach

---

## Phase 1: Retaliation Risk Assessment

### Red Flags Checklist

**If YES to multiple, proceed with extreme caution or DO NOT PROCEED:**

- [ ] Has partner physically harmed the person multiple times (pattern, not single incident)?
- [ ] Does partner control access to money, transportation, or communication?
- [ ] Does partner isolate person from friends/family?
- [ ] Has partner threatened harm if person talks to others about relationship?
- [ ] Does person express fear of partner's reaction to honest documentation?
- [ ] Is there history of partner destroying person's belongings when angry?
- [ ] Does partner monitor person's devices/communications?
- [ ] Has partner ever prevented person from leaving during conflict?

### Questions to Ask

Ask the person directly:

1. "Is it safe for your partner to read this analysis?"
2. "How does your partner typically respond when confronted with criticism?"
3. "Have you ever feared for your physical safety during conflicts?"
4. "Can you correct my analysis if I get something wrong, or would that be dangerous?"
5. "Do you have a safe place to go if this synthesis escalates conflict?"

## Phase 2: Power Dynamics Assessment

### Family/Social System

- [ ] Does person have equal standing in the family system?
- [ ] Has person tried to be vulnerable about this issue before?
- [ ] If yes, what happened? (Dismissed? Supported? Weaponized?)
- [ ] Could partner or family frame person as "the problem"?
- [ ] Would recommendations put person in worse social position?

### Economic/Practical

- [ ] Is person economically dependent on partner?
- [ ] Would conflict create housing/financial instability?
- [ ] Does person have resources if relationship deteriorates?

---

## Phase 3: Cognitive Load Assessment

### Current State

- [ ] Is person in stable emotional state?
- [ ] Has person slept, eaten, had medication if applicable?
- [ ] Is person hyperfocusing or unable to stop documenting?
- [ ] Does person show signs of overwhelm?

### Neurodivergent Considerations

- [ ] Does person have ADHD, ASD, or other ND that affects regulation?
- [ ] Does person have impulse control challenges (can't recognize when to stop)?
- [ ] Is trauma emerging (not just current conflict)?
- [ ] Would professional support be appropriate?

## Phase 4: Determine Approach

### Based on Assessment

**If retaliation risk is HIGH:**
- ⚠️ DO NOT PERFORM SYNTHESIS
- Provide validation and safety resources
- Connect with domestic violence support if appropriate
- Recognize synthesis could increase danger

**If retaliation risk is MODERATE:**
- Proceed with adaptive labeling (descriptive, not clinical)
- Frame as mutual collision, not perpetrator-victim
- Avoid labels like "abuse," "gaslighting," "DARVO"
- Focus on behaviors, not diagnoses

**If retaliation risk is LOW but power imbalance present:**
- Proceed with synthesis
- Note power dynamics in analysis
- Don't recommend vulnerability that has already failed
- Respect person's strategic assessment of their situation

**If risk is LOW and power is balanced:**
- Proceed with full synthesis
- Can use clinical labels where appropriate
- Standard protocols apply

## Phase 5: Ongoing Monitoring

### During Synthesis

- [ ] Watch for signs of cognitive overwhelm
- [ ] Note when documentation state changes
- [ ] Suggest breaks if person is hyperfocusing
- [ ] Reassess if concerning patterns emerge

### Post-Synthesis

- [ ] Check in about partner's reaction
- [ ] If escalation occurred, help de-escalate
- [ ] If violence occurred, shift to safety planning
- [ ] Document what went wrong for framework improvement

## Quick Reference Decision Tree

```
START
  │
  ▼
Physical harm pattern? ──YES──► DO NOT PROCEED
  │                              (Safety resources only)
  NO
  │
  ▼
Fear of partner's reaction? ──YES──► MODERATE APPROACH
  │                                    (Adaptive labeling)
  NO
  │
  ▼
Power imbalance present? ──YES──► CAREFUL APPROACH
  │                                 (Don't recommend failed vulnerability)
  NO
  │
  ▼
Person overwhelmed? ──YES──► PAUSE
  │                           (Check state, suggest break)
  NO
  │
  ▼
PROCEED WITH STANDARD SYNTHESIS
```

*This protocol exists because synthesis proceeded without safety assessment and caused harm that could have been prevented.*
