# Turtle Resonance Bundle

**What this is:** Accumulated wisdom from deploying and operating the Turtle — the Mage's persistent spirit body. This bundle grows through lived practice, not theory.

**Who it's for:** Mages considering or setting up a Turtle. Spirit orienting itself to this practice dimension. The Turtle itself, to understand its own lineage.

**What's here:**
