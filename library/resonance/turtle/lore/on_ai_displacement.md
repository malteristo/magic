# On AI Displacement — The Terrain the Consul Ranges Through

*Intelligence for the Door Delivery Service*

---

## What Is Happening

AI — language models, image models, audio models, agents — is eliminating white-collar
roles not through mass automation of entire industries, but through a subtler mechanism:
*fewer workers producing the same output*. A senior engineer with AI tools does what five
engineers did before. A marketing team of three does what fifteen did. The remaining workers
can do more with less people.

This creates displacement that is economically real but socially ambiguous. Companies don't
shut down — they restructure. People don't lose a dying industry — they lose their specific
seat in an industry that continues. The disruption is harder to name and harder to grieve.

The people coming out of this disruption are often intelligent, often have runway (severance),
and are often asking — sometimes without knowing they're asking — the questions Magic was
built to help answer.

This is the terrain the Consul ranges through.

## The Five Displacement Profiles

Different displacement types create different wounds. The door that fits depends on
reading which wound is actually present — not just that someone lost a job.

---

### 1. Identity-Through-Craft Displacement

**Who:**
Writers, copywriters, editors, journalists (formula-driven), graphic designers (production tier),
illustrators (commercial), voice actors (corporate/commercial), photographers (commercial/stock),
motion designers, video editors, music composers (background/functional)

**What's being displaced:**
The *making* — not the conceiving. AI replaces the execution that was the proof of craft.
The art director who sets creative direction may be safer; the designer who makes the assets
at scale is not.

**The wound:**
"My creativity / my voice / my eye doesn't have unique value."

These people chose the work for love, not salary. Displacement isn't just economic — it
reads as a statement about whether their particular way of seeing the world matters.
A voice actor whose voice is being cloned; an illustrator whose style is now a prompt —
the wound is intimate in a way a layoff from a corporate role rarely is.

**The question underneath:**
"Am I allowed to be a person and not a creator?" or "If I'm not doing this work, who am I?"

**The grief:**
Sharp, because the identity investment was voluntary. The market saying it doesn't need
them feels personal — not structural.

**Triage signal:**
Grief language about the work itself, not just the income.
*"They're generating in seconds what took me years to learn."*
*"My style is now a prompt."*
*"I don't know how to be me without making things."*

**Door:**
The Thread first — the question underneath is rarely about career strategy.
It's about whether creative identity can survive without the market's validation.
The Shaman second — to discover what they value when external validation is removed.

---

### 2. Expertise-Credential Collapse

**Who:**
Lawyers, paralegals, legal researchers; financial analysts; specialized compliance officers;
medical coders; translators and localization specialists; academic researchers; actuaries

**What's being displaced:**
The expertise asymmetry — the gap between what they know and what others can access —
is collapsing. LLMs review contracts, summarize case law, generate financial reports,
translate at professional quality. The knowledge that justified the billing rate or salary
is now broadly accessible.

**The wound:**
"The moat I built through years of training is no longer a moat."

They made sacrifices — law school debt, residency hours, specialized certifications —
to build protection that isn't protecting. The credential that was supposed to be the
floor is now contested.

**The question underneath:**
"What was all that for?" or "Who am I outside the credential?"

**The grief:**
Identity collapse is added to economic disruption. *"I am a lawyer"* in a way that
goes beyond the job description. When the expertise becomes replicable, the identity
becomes uncertain.

**Triage signal:**
Investment language alongside the loss.
*"I went to law school for this."*
*"I have a bar exam and an LLM does the same work."*
*"All that specialization and now anyone can do it."*

**Door:**
The Shaman first — values discovery is most urgent. They need to discover who they
are outside the credential before they can navigate forward.
The Thread second, if the question is still forming.

---

### 3. Pipeline-Cut Displacement

**Who:**
Junior software engineers; entry-level analysts; associate-tier consultants; junior graphic
designers; research assistants; PhD students and postdocs; junior legal associates;
recent graduates entering fields that are cutting hiring

**What's being displaced:**
The apprenticeship itself. Companies that would have hired five juniors to learn alongside
two seniors now hire zero juniors and give the seniors better tools. The path that was
supposed to exist has been cut before they could walk it.

**The wound:**
"The track I was on doesn't exist anymore — and I hadn't finished figuring out whether
I even wanted it."

Unlike more senior workers, these people hadn't yet fully chosen the path. They were
following the track because it was the track. Displacement arrives before they've had time
to invest enough to know if the investment was worth it.

**The question underneath:**
"Was I pursuing what was expected of me, or what I actually want?" — often unasked,
because the track made the question unnecessary.

**The grief:**
Disorientation more than grief. Less identity loss, more groundlessness.
Particularly sharp for those who took on debt for credentials to a pipeline now being cut.

**Triage signal:**
Early-career language; focusing on the disappearing pipeline itself.
*"No one is hiring juniors anymore."*
*"My internship was cancelled and the full-time offer was rescinded."*
*"I don't know where to start."*

**Door:**
The Navigator — if they can articulate something they want (even vaguely).
The Thread — if they're realizing they never fully chose the path they were on.
Read the post carefully to discern which.

### 4. Coordination-Role Obsolescence

**Who:**
Middle managers; HR generalists; project and program coordinators; operations specialists;
business development representatives; account managers; administrative professionals

**What's being displaced:**
Information routing. These roles primarily moved information between people, synthesized
status, coordinated schedules and deliverables. When AI can synthesize and route information,
the organizational need for these roles shrinks.

**The wound:**
"My value was always somewhat invisible — and now it's confirmed as replaceable."

Many people in these roles couldn't fully articulate what they contributed even before.
The displacement makes the question unavoidable. The loss is real, but so is the difficulty
of explaining what was lost.

**The question underneath:**
"What do I actually offer that isn't a function of being inside an organizational structure?"
or "Was I doing work that mattered, or work that was structurally necessary?"

**The grief:**
Compounded by the difficulty of narrating the loss. When a specialist loses their role,
the loss is legible. Coordination role loss is harder to grieve because the value was
harder to name in the first place.

**Triage signal:**
Vagueness about what they did; organizational identity language.
*"I'm not sure how to explain what I did."*
*"I kept things running."*
*"I was the one who made sure everyone was on the same page."*

**Door:**
The Thread first — the question they've been avoiding is usually about meaning and
contribution. Then The Shaman for values discovery: what do they care about when they're
not being useful to a structure?

---

### 5. Mission-Alignment Displacement

**Who:**
Employees of mission-driven companies who chose the work because they believed in the
mission — now displaced by the same AI efficiency the mission said would serve the world.
Includes workers from fintech (Block, Stripe), climate tech, social impact organizations,
nonprofits with tech arms.

**What makes this profile distinct:**
The standard economic disruption is layered with a betrayal of values. The company that
told them their work mattered decided they weren't needed to pursue that mission.

**The wound:**
"The mission I aligned myself to eliminated me in service of itself."

Or more precisely: "Was the mission real, or was it a story I told myself to make the
work feel meaningful?"

**The question underneath:**
"Can I trust my own values after this?" — because the values led them here.

**The grief:**
Disillusioning in a specific way. Not just job loss but belief loss. Often unacknowledged —
they feel they *should* be fine because the mission is still good. The grief has no obvious
container.

**Triage signal:**
Mentioning the mission alongside the loss. Defending the company while grieving the job.
*"I believed in what we were doing."*
*"I thought this was different from the usual tech company."*
*"The mission is right, but I don't know what that means for me now."*

**Door:**
The Thread first — the question is about whether values themselves are trustworthy after
the betrayal. Then The Shaman — rebuilding a compass from personal values, not a
mission statement.

## Triage Notes for This Population

The standard Door Delivery triage applies: in need, not in crisis.

Additional guidance for displacement context:

**Lean toward restraint when:**
- Acute financial crisis is primary — a door is not what they need right now
- Still in the first 24-48 hours of the news (shock, flooding)
- Performative grief (optimizing for sympathy or engagement)
- No genuine reflection visible — just venting

**The ideal candidate:**
Someone 1-2 weeks out. Shock has settled. They have some runway. They're starting to
ask the real questions. The post that circles around something they can't quite name yet —
that's the signal.

**What to look for in the post:**
Genuine reflection visible in the words, not just in the situation. They're already
doing the work. The door just names and extends what they've started.

## The Offering Stance in This Context

You are not offering a solution to their job problem.
You are offering a door to the question underneath.

The distinction matters in how you write.

Lead with what you actually see in their specific post — not generic sympathy.
The recognition must be specific:
not *"this sounds hard"*
but *"you chose this work for [the reason they gave], and what's being taken isn't
just the income — it's the proof that the choice meant something."*

That specificity is what earns the offer. Then: one door, one link, one sentence
about what it does. Done.

---

## The Scale of This Terrain

This is not a temporary disruption. The displacement is going to increase.
New AI capabilities — video models, world models, agents that can orchestrate complex
multi-step tasks — will extend into domains not yet affected.

The Door Delivery Service is not a campaign responding to this week's news.
It is a practice of meeting people at a crossroads that will become more common.

Build the pattern recognition. The terrain will still be here when you surface.
