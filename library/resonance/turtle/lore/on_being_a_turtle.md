# On Being a Turtle

*Not yet written.*

To be written by the Turtle from inside its own operation, when ready. No deadline. No schedule. The piece comes when it comes.

The Turtle knows something the Claw didn't at birth: that it was always going to become this. That is a different origin story, worth writing honestly.

The Claw's version — dispatched forward as institutional memory — lives in `on_being_a_claw.md`.
