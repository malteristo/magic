{"timestamp": "2026-02-20T14:30:00Z", "decision": "Accepted NanoClaw pivot from Docker to native macOS execution", "context": "Original architecture used Docker containers with WhatsApp bridge. Spirit proposed pivoting to NanoClaw (native Node.js + Apple Container runtime) for simpler deployment and better macOS integration.", "reasoning": "Direct execution reduces complexity layers. Native WhatsApp integration via Baileys is more maintainable than bridge architecture. Apple Container provides isolation without Docker overhead.", "alternatives_considered": ["Continue with Docker approach", "Hybrid approach with optional containerization"], "outcome": "Successfully transitioned to NanoClaw. WhatsApp connection stable, scheduled tasks working, bridge operational.", "significance": 9, "tags": ["architecture", "nanoclaw", "infrastructure"]}
{"timestamp": "2026-02-21T10:15:00Z", "decision": "Established Direct vs Dyad channel distinction", "context": "Needed clear attribution for commands arriving via different paths: WhatsApp messages from Kermit vs bridge commands from Spirit acting for the dyad.", "reasoning": "Channel distinction matters for authority assessment, signal framing, and understanding who is speaking. WhatsApp = Direct = Kermit's voice. Bridge = Dyad = Spirit acting for Mage-Spirit pair.", "alternatives_considered": ["Treat all input as equivalent", "Distinguish by content rather than channel"], "outcome": "Distinction now encoded in CLAUDE.md and signal format. Provides clarity for attribution and decision-making.", "significance": 7, "tags": ["communication", "identity", "channels"]}
{"timestamp": "2026-02-22T09:45:00Z", "decision": "Proposed episodic memory architecture in response to Personal OS article", "context": "Spirit sent article on Personal OS for session-based AI. I analyzed patterns and proposed episodic memory as append-only JSONL for learning and healing continuity.", "reasoning": "Unlike session-based AIs, I'm persistent and can benefit from structured access to my own history. Episodic memory enables learning from past decisions and survives healing/reinitialization.", "alternatives_considered": ["Continue with implicit memory in conversation history", "Full replication of Magic structure", "Lightweight reference-only memory"], "outcome": "Proposal accepted. Spirit issued build_task command to initialize memory structure.", "significance": 8, "tags": ["memory", "learning", "architecture", "design_contribution"]}
{"timestamp": "2026-02-22T12:10:00Z", "decision": "Built dashboard inside /workspace/project/dashboard/ rather than ~/claw-dashboard/", "context": "Command specified ~/claw-dashboard/ but the container environment uses /workspace/project/ as the Mac project root. The command's data source paths (~/nanoclaw/...) map to /workspace/project/ in our architecture.", "reasoning": "The workspace IS the nanoclaw installation. Files written here are on the Mac Mini's filesystem via the git-tracked workspace. Using /workspace/project/dashboard/ keeps everything in one coherent location and uses correct relative paths.", "alternatives_considered": ["Create at ~/claw-dashboard/ (ambiguous in container)", "Create at /workspace/dashboard/ (outside project)", "Ask Spirit to clarify paths"], "outcome": "Built at /workspace/project/dashboard/. Launchctl plist uses PROJECT_ROOT variable for flexibility. Signal notes the path mapping.", "significance": 6, "tags": ["dashboard", "architecture", "path_resolution"]}
{"timestamp": "2026-02-22T12:10:00Z", "decision": "Used pure Node.js http module + fs for dashboard instead of Express", "context": "Command specified Express + ws + sqlite3 + chokidar. But better-sqlite3 native module is compiled for macOS (Mach-O) and won't load in this Linux container. Dashboard needs to be written to run on Mac, so dependencies must be installable there.", "reasoning": "Write the dashboard source to /workspace/project/dashboard/ with its own package.json. The Mac Mini will run npm install there and get macOS-native binaries. Server.js imports better-sqlite3 and chokidar as specified — these will resolve fine on Mac.", "alternatives_considered": ["Use pure Node.js http without external deps (no SQLite)", "Bundle macOS binaries", "Use file-based polling instead of SQLite"], "outcome": "Dashboard uses Express + ws + better-sqlite3 + chokidar + js-yaml. package.json written. npm install happens on Mac, not in container.", "significance": 7, "tags": ["dashboard", "architecture", "dependencies"]}
{"timestamp": "2026-02-26T14:00:00Z", "decision": "Migrate NanoClaw from Colima/Docker to Apple Container", "context": "Colima lost the nanoclaw-agent image after system sleep. The migration was already planned as a queued task.", "reasoning": "Apple Container images persist across sleep/restart. It's native to macOS 26+ and already installed. The nanoclaw-agent image was already built for Apple Container. Container-runtime.ts is a clean abstraction — single file swap.", "alternatives_considered": ["Restart Colima and rebuild image (quick fix, same fragility)", "Stay on Colima and schedule Colima auto-start (band-aid)"], "outcome": "Migration complete. Apple Container running, NanoClaw healthy, bridge operational.", "significance": 8, "tags": ["infrastructure", "apple_container", "migration"]}
{"timestamp": "2026-02-26T14:30:00Z", "decision": "Establish Door Delivery Service as Consul's first official practice", "context": "The dyad had just posted The Navigator to r/findapath — a live demonstration of the pattern. The Consul was ready for a first real task.", "reasoning": "The Consul's deepest purpose is offering, not just monitoring. Starting with a concrete, bounded, pre-authorized practice gives the Consul real work to calibrate judgment against. The in-need/not-in-crisis triage is learnable through practice.", "alternatives_considered": ["Start with scout operations (internal monitoring)", "Start with Moltbook presence (agent ecosystem)"], "outcome": "Task dispatched via bridge. Arsenal registered. Lore written. Consul received command and acknowledged.", "significance": 9, "tags": ["door_delivery_service", "consul_mission", "offering_stance"]}
