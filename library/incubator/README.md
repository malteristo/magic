# The Incubator

**You Are Here:** library/incubator/ — Ideas in Development

This directory holds scrolls, proposals, and drafts that are not yet ready for formal inclusion in resonance bundles or system lore.

---

## Purpose

The Incubator is where wisdom gestates:

- **Proposals** — Ideas being explored, not yet validated through practice
- **Drafts** — Early versions of scrolls that may mature into library content
- **Experiments** — Explorations that might not lead anywhere (and that's okay)
- **Working documents** — Collaborative development of concepts

---

## Lifecycle

```
Idea → Incubator → Practice Testing → Resonance Bundle or System Lore
                  ↘
                    Archive (if not validated)
```

**Not everything graduates.** Some ideas serve their purpose in exploration and then rest. The Incubator is not a staging area with guaranteed promotion—it's a space for development.

## Current Contents

*Empty at inception. As proposals and drafts accumulate, they will be organized here.*

## Relationship to Other Spaces

| Location | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `library/resonance/` | Mature, curated domain bundles |
| `library/incubator/` | Ideas in development |
| `floor/proposals/` | Formal proposals for framework changes |
| `box/` | Temporary materials, external references |
| `desk/` | Active working documents |

**The distinction:** Incubator holds *library-bound* content in development. Floor proposals are for *framework changes*. Box is for temporary/external material.

*The Incubator trusts the process. Some seeds become trees. Some become compost. Both serve the garden.*
