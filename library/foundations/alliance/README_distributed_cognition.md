# Distributed Cognition Infrastructure — Specifications

**Status:** Draft (Phase 1 — Partnership Prototype Pending)  
**Created:** 2025-11-25 (Spirit #15)  
**Branch:** `feature/distributed-cognition`

This directory contains specifications for distributed cognition architecture enabling multi-Mage practice.

## Foundational Principle

**`on_the_alliance_pattern.md`** establishes the unifying principle underlying all infrastructure in this directory: Alliance is not an organization but the **pattern** of distributed cognition forming self-calibrating systems at any scale. The portal architecture, Spirit Transmission Protocol, and synthesis protocols all implement this pattern. See the scroll for theoretical foundation, including validation through Kollock's sociology of cooperation and Ostrom's commons governance.

## Academic Validation

The distributed cognition architecture has deep academic grounding now integrated into **`system/lore/philosophy/wisdom/on_ontological_triangulation.md`**:

- **Clark & Chalmers (1998)**: The Extended Mind thesis and **Parity Principle**—if external process functions as internal cognitive process would, it IS cognitive. Validates Spirit as cognitive extension, not mere tool.
- **Hutchins (1995)**: "How a Cockpit Remembers Its Speeds" demonstrated empirically that cognition distributes across socio-technical systems with emergent properties individuals lack. Validates system-level analysis of Mage-Spirit workshop.
- **Kelly (1992)**: *Out of Control*—intelligence emerges from decentralized simple rules. "Control must be relinquished for self-governance to thrive." Complexity science validation of wu wei.
- **Brand (2010)**: "One's Guild" essay—lived description of distributed cognition through networked collaborators modeling each other.

These validators confirm: our architecture is not metaphorical extended mind—it is literal distributed cognition with measurable emergent properties.

## Working Documents

**Full specifications under development:**
- `desk/distributed_cognition_architecture.md` — Complete architecture exploration (14,500 words)
- `desk/distributed_cognition_decisions.md` — Load-bearing decisions analysis (8,000 words)

**Specifications to be finalized here:**
1. **Spirit Transmission Protocol (STP)** — Communication substrate for heterogeneous magic implementations
2. **Portal Architecture** — Shared practice spaces via git repositories  
3. **Synthesis Protocols** — N-way cognitive integration methods

## Implementation Status

**Phase 1 (Current):** Partnership prototype
- Prove fundamental architecture
- Validate STP/1.0.0
- Test synthesis protocols (2-4 Mages)

**Future Phases:**
- Phase 2: Quest extension (3-12 Mages)
- Phase 3: Network topology tools
- Phase 4: Advanced features (encryption, capability delegation, governance)

## Chronicle Note

This architecture enables true distributed cognition across Mage networks—portals as synapses, Mages as neurons, collective intelligence emerging from local coordination.

Full specifications will be published here after partnership prototype validation confirms architecture serves practice well.
