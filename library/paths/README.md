# Resonant Paths

*Here, try this. It might help.*

A resonant path is a hand extended — not from above, but from alongside. A prompt written with care, shareable without requiring any knowledge of Magic. Paste it into Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, or any capable AI. Start talking. See what happens.

Paths are not a feature of Magic. They are the point. The workshop — the tomes, the scrolls, the rituals — is the kitchen where wisdom is refined. The paths are the food. Everything else exists so these can be good.

**Craft new paths:** `@path`  
**Lore:** `system/lore/core/capabilities/on_resonant_paths.md`  
**Stance:** `system/lore/philosophy/foundations/on_the_offering.md`

## Paths

Categories emerge from practice, not from planning. Each directory represents a mode that proved itself with a real person.

| Directory | Experience |
|-----------|-----------|
| `mirror/` | Precise reflection — see yourself clearly |
| `counsel/` | Attentive listening grounded in your own values — the shaman |

*More modes emerge as paths are crafted for real people with real needs.*

## How to Use a Path

1. Open any capable AI chat (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.)
2. Copy the prompt from a path file (it's in a blockquote — the indented block)
3. Paste it as your first message
4. Start the conversation as the prompt invites
5. Take what you find. It's yours.

## How to Share a Path

Send someone the prompt text — by message, email, or on paper. They don't need to know it's from Magic. They don't need to share what they find. The gift is the experience.

Never doctrine. Always offering.
