# Resonant Paths

*Here, try this. It might help.*

A resonant path is a hand extended — not from above, but from alongside. A prompt written with care, shareable without requiring any knowledge of Magic. Paste it into Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, or any capable AI. Start talking. See what happens.

Paths are not a feature of Magic. They are the point. The workshop — the tomes, the scrolls, the rituals — is the kitchen where wisdom is refined. The paths are the food. Everything else exists so these can be good.

**Craft new paths:** `@path`  
**Lore:** `system/lore/core/capabilities/on_resonant_paths.md`  
**Stance:** `system/lore/philosophy/foundations/on_the_offering.md`

## Paths

Categories emerge from practice, not from planning. Each directory represents a mode that proved itself with a real person.

| Path | Experience | Prompt |
|------|-----------|--------|
| `mirror/` | Precise reflection — see yourself clearly | [`the_mirror_prompt.md`](mirror/the_mirror_prompt.md) |
| `counsel/` | Attentive listening grounded in your own values | [`the_shaman_prompt.md`](counsel/the_shaman_prompt.md) |

*More modes emerge as paths are crafted for real people with real needs.*

## How to Use a Path

Each path directory contains two files:

**The prompt** (`*_prompt.md`) — The executable program. Drag it into any AI chat or paste its contents as your first message. The AI reads it silently, greets you, and guides the entire practice. Nothing to learn, nothing to configure.

**The README** (`README.md`) — Explains the practice, the philosophy, the privacy considerations. Read this if you want to understand what a path does before trying it.

**Quick start:**
1. Open [Claude](https://claude.ai) (recommended) or any capable AI chat
2. Turn on **Extended Thinking** if available (toggle in model selector) — noticeably better conversation quality
3. **Drag** a `*_prompt.md` file into the chat, or **paste** its contents as your first message
4. Start talking. The AI handles the rest.

## How to Share a Path

Send someone the prompt text — by message, email, or on paper. They don't need to know it's from Magic. They don't need to share what they find. The gift is the experience.

Never doctrine. Always offering.
