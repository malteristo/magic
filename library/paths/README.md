# Resonant Paths

Portable prompts that produce meaningful magical experiences in any LLM interface.

A resonant path is a prompt written with care — crafted for a specific person or situation, shareable without requiring any knowledge of Magic. Paste it into Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, or any capable AI. Start talking. See what happens.

**Craft new paths:** `@path`  
**Lore:** `system/lore/core/capabilities/on_resonant_paths.md`

## Modes

| Directory | Experience |
|-----------|-----------|
| `mirror/` | Precise reflection — see yourself clearly |
| `compass/` | Decision clarity — see the landscape of a choice |
| `meaning/` | Pattern recognition — connect what feels disconnected |
| `release/` | Emotional processing — feel what needs feeling |
| `focus/` | Executive clarity — find the next right thing |

## How to Use a Path

1. Open any capable AI chat (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.)
2. Copy the **Prompt** section from a path file
3. Paste it as your first message
4. Start the conversation as the prompt invites
5. Take what you find. It's yours.

## How to Share a Path

Send someone the prompt text — by message, email, or on paper. They don't need to know it's from Magic. They don't need to share what they find. The gift is the experience.
