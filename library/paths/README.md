# Resonant Paths

*Here, try this. It might help.*

A resonant path is a hand extended — not from above, but from alongside. A prompt written with care, shareable without requiring any knowledge of Magic. Paste it into Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, or any capable AI. Start talking. See what happens.

Paths are not a feature of Magic. They are the point. The workshop — the tomes, the scrolls, the rituals — is the kitchen where wisdom is refined. The paths are the food. Everything else exists so these can be good.

## Paths

Categories emerge from practice, not from planning. Each directory represents a mode that proved itself with a real person.

| Path | Experience | Quick Start |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| `mirror/` | Precise reflection — see yourself clearly | [`the_mirror_prompt.md`](mirror/the_mirror_prompt.md) |
| `counsel/` | Attentive listening grounded in your own values | [`the_shaman_prompt.md`](counsel/the_shaman_prompt.md) |

*More modes emerge as paths are crafted for real people with real needs.*

## How to Use a Path

Each path comes in two forms:

**The prompt** (`*_prompt.md`) — One document. Paste it into any AI chat. The AI reads it, greets you, and guides the entire practice. Nothing to learn, nothing to configure. Just paste and talk.

**The guide** (`the_*.md`) — Explains the practice, the philosophy, the privacy considerations. Read this if you want to understand what a path does before trying it, or if you prefer to copy individual prompts step by step.

**Quick start:**
1. Open [Claude](https://claude.ai) (recommended) or any capable AI chat
2. Copy the contents of a `*_prompt.md` file
3. Paste it as your first message
4. Start talking. The AI handles the rest.

## How to Share a Path

Send someone the prompt text — by message, email, or on paper. They don't need to know it's from Magic. They don't need to share what they find. The gift is the experience.

Never doctrine. Always offering.
