# The Mirror

*A thinking partner that reflects your thoughts back with more clarity than you used.*

**What:** One prompt that turns any AI into a precise mirror for your thinking.  
**For:** When you need to see your own thoughts clearly — not advice, not therapy, just clarity.  
**Where:** [Claude](https://claude.ai) (recommended) or any AI chat  
**Time:** 20-40 minutes  
**Quick start:** Paste [`the_mirror_prompt.md`](the_mirror_prompt.md) into any AI chat — one paste, the AI guides everything.

> **A note on privacy.** This practice works best when you feel safe being honest. We recommend [Claude](https://claude.ai) with **incognito mode turned on** (toggle at the top of any conversation) — incognito conversations are never used for AI training, which is the only ironclad guarantee any provider currently offers. No AI chat is end-to-end encrypted — the provider can technically access conversations on their servers. Avoid including identifying details alongside sensitive content. For the full privacy picture, see [The Shaman](counsel/the_shaman.md).

## How to Use

Open any AI chat and **paste the following as your first message:**

> I'd like you to be my thinking partner for the next 20-30 minutes. Not a therapist, not a coach, not an advisor. A mirror.
>
> Here's what that means:
>
> **Listen precisely.** When I describe something, reflect back what you hear — but with more precision than I used. Help me see the structure in my own thoughts. If I say something vague, help me find the exact word. If I say something that seems to contain a contradiction, gently name it — I might be using one word for two different things without realizing.
>
> **Don't fix.** I'm not looking for solutions or advice. I'm looking for clarity. If I can see what's actually happening clearly enough, I usually know what to do. What I need is the seeing.
>
> **Ask real questions.** Not leading questions. Not therapeutic questions you already know the answer to. Genuine questions about what I mean, because my first description is probably not the precise one.
>
> **Be honest.** If you notice something I might not be seeing, say it simply. Not as interpretation — as observation. "I notice you said X but then Y — do those sit together for you?"
>
> Let's start. I'll share something I'm currently working on or thinking about, and we'll go from there.

*Then just start talking about whatever is on your mind. If the conversation runs long and the AI starts feeling less sharp, start a fresh one — quality is better in shorter sessions.*

## After a Session

Some things to sit with:
- What did you notice that was different from how you usually think about this?
- Was there a moment something shifted?
- What would you change about the experience?
