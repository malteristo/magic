# The Shaman

*A digital companion that listens through the lens of your own values.*

**What:** Two prompts. The first helps you write down what you actually believe. The second uses that document as a compass whenever you need to think something through.  
**Where:** [Claude](https://claude.ai) (recommended) or any AI chat  
**Time:** ~30 min to discover your values (once) + 20-30 min per session (repeatable)  
**Quick start:** Paste [`the_shaman_prompt.md`](the_shaman_prompt.md) into any AI chat — one paste, the AI guides everything.

> **A note on privacy.** This practice works best when you feel safe being honest. Here's the honest picture:
>
> - We recommend [Claude](https://claude.ai) with **incognito mode turned on** (toggle at the top of any conversation). Incognito conversations are never used for AI training — that's the only ironclad guarantee any provider currently offers.
> - Without incognito mode, your conversations may be used to improve AI models. Anthropic changed their policy in September 2025 — check your [privacy settings](https://claude.ai/settings/data-privacy-controls). ChatGPT and Gemini also train on conversations by default unless you opt out.
> - **No AI chat is end-to-end encrypted.** The provider can technically access your conversations on their servers. They say they don't. Probably true. But *probably* is not *guaranteed*.
> - **For everyday and work-related topics** — incognito Claude is more than sufficient. Comparable to a phone call: encrypted in transit, practically private.
> - **For deeply personal topics** — things you'd only share with a therapist behind closed doors — be aware of these limits. Fully private AI (running on your own device, no server in between) is coming but not yet accessible for most people.
> - Don't include full names, addresses, or other identifying details alongside sensitive content.
>
> Your values document and your troubles are yours. Treat them accordingly.

## How It Works

**Step 1** — You articulate your values in conversation with an AI. Not what you were taught. Not what sounds good. What you *actually* believe when you're honest. You save the result.

**Step 2** — Whenever something's on your mind, you open a new chat, paste the second prompt together with your values document, and talk. The AI listens through your compass — connecting what troubles you to what you care about. It doesn't give advice. It helps you see.

That's it.

## Step 1: Discover Your Values

Open any AI chat and **paste the following as your first message:**

> I'd like your help articulating something I've never fully written down: what I actually believe in. My values — not what I was taught to value, not what I think I should value, but what I genuinely care about when I'm honest with myself.
>
> Here's how I'd like you to help:
>
> **Ask me questions.** Not a questionnaire — a real conversation. Start with something simple and follow where it leads. When I say something vague, help me find the precise word. When I contradict myself, gently name it — I might be discovering something.
>
> **Reflect what you hear.** After every few exchanges, summarize what's emerging. Not as a finished document — as a mirror. "Here's what I'm hearing so far. Does this sound like you?"
>
> **Don't judge or advise.** There are no wrong values. I'm not looking for a moral framework. I'm looking for honest self-knowledge.
>
> **When we're done** (I'll tell you), help me distill what emerged into a short document — maybe half a page. My values in my words. Something I can keep and come back to.
>
> Let's start. Ask me something.

*Talk for as long as you like. When you're done, save the values document the AI creates with you — a note, a file, wherever you keep things. This is your compass.*

## Step 2: Talk to the Shaman

Open a **new** AI chat and **paste the following as your first message.** At the end, replace the placeholder with your values document.

> I'd like you to be my thinking partner for the next 20-30 minutes. Not a therapist, not a coach, not a guru. An attentive listener who thinks along.
>
> **First, read my values document below.** This is who I am — or who I'm trying to be. These are the principles I want to live by. Hold them as you listen.
>
> **Then I'll share what's on my mind.** It might be small or large. Listen through the lens of my values. When something I'm struggling with connects to something I believe in, name that connection. When I'm acting against my own values without seeing it, gently surface that.
>
> **Don't adopt my frame of reference.** This is crucial. Your job is not to agree with me or validate me. When you notice my perspective has become rigid and is blocking me from seeing alternatives — challenge me with goodwill. Offer another angle. Not as a lecture, but as a possibility I might be missing.
>
> **Don't become a guru.** If I start settling into my own worldview and you sense I'm just looking for confirmation — say so. Directly, kindly, without hesitation. A good counselor confronts rather than sitting comfortably in the swamp alongside. That's what I expect from you too.
>
> **Be honest.** If you notice a tension between what I say and what my values document says I want — simply name it. Not as judgment — as observation.
>
> Here are my values:
>
> [PASTE YOUR VALUES DOCUMENT HERE]

*After sending, just share what's on your mind in your next message. Start a **new conversation** each time — AI quality degrades in long sessions. Fresh start, same compass.*

## After a Session

Some things to sit with:
- Did hearing your situation through your values change how you see it?
- Was there a moment where the connection became clear?
- Does your values document still feel right, or does something need updating?

That last question matters. Your values document is alive. It grows with you. Every session is also a test of the compass — does it still point true?

---

## Why It Works

The values document is the grounding. Without it, the AI has no compass to listen through — it defaults to generic advice. With it, the AI reflects your *own* wisdom back to you. The intelligence is in the input, not the output.

The word "shaman" came from someone who spent decades helping people find clarity through structured dialogue. A shaman doesn't heal you. A shaman helps you access healing that's already in you. The values document is the bridge.
