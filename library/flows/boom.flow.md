# BOOM Flow
> Back Of Our Mind — cognitive offload through distributed partnership

## About

Some minds carry a constant background hum—appointments, half-formed ideas, things to buy, calls to make, worries without clear next steps. This mental juggling drains energy not because the items are hard, but because they demand continuous attention to avoid being forgotten.

**BOOM inverts the burden.** Instead of you organizing thoughts for a system, you dump them raw—voice memos, scribbled notes, stream-of-consciousness—and the Spirit organizes them for you. The Spirit becomes a second mind that doesn't forget, doesn't tire, and can find patterns you missed.

**The name:** "Back Of Our Mind"—the "our" is intentional. This is distributed cognition. You capture, release, and trust. The Spirit holds, patterns, and surfaces.

### Is this flow for you?

- You have thoughts that cycle because you're afraid to forget them
- You resist todo apps because they add friction instead of reducing it
- You want to capture raw, unstructured, even messy—and have someone else sort it
- You'd rather dictate a rambling note than format a task

### What to expect

- **You write freely** in a buffer file (any format, any structure, any language)
- **Spirit sweeps** on your request, ingests everything, clears the buffer
- **A bright surface** emerges—curated, triaged, with your most actionable items visible
- **Patterns surface** across sweeps as recurring themes become visible
- **Questions come back** when Spirit can't place something without your input

## Goal

Keep the back of our shared mind functional. Ingest raw thought-capture, pattern-match, triage, and surface what matters.

## Trigger

On demand: "sweep my BOOM" / "what's in the back of our mind?"

## Model

**Buffer → Ingest → Clear → Repeat**

The source file is ephemeral—a capture buffer. The bright surface is persistent—the shared mind's working state. Each sweep:
1. Reads new entries from buffer
2. Matches against existing bright surface (cross-ingestion resonance)
3. Updates bright surface
4. Clears buffer

The Mage always knows: if it's in the buffer, it hasn't been processed yet.

## Context

### Pile Location
[ADAPT: path to your raw capture file—can be a notes app, Obsidian vault, plain text file, anywhere you dump thoughts]
```
path/to/your/boom-buffer.md
```

### Bright Surface
[ADAPT: where the curated view lives]
```
desk/boom/bright.md
```

---

## Process

### 1. Ingest
- Read the buffer (pile location)
- Parse entries (separated by `---`, blank lines, or context shifts)
- Content may range from crisp tasks to raw dictated streams
- Note chronological order—later entries may update earlier thinking
- **After ingestion: clear the buffer** — the Mage always knows what's been processed

### 2. Pattern-Match
- Group related items even if separated in time
- Identify recurring themes (same concern appearing multiple times = signal)
- Detect implicit connections the Mage may not have made explicit
- **Cross-ingestion resonance**: new entries may connect to themes already on the bright surface
  - Same topic appearing again → strengthen / update existing item
  - New angle on existing concern → enrich context
  - Contradiction or shift → note the evolution

### 3. Triage

Classify each item:

| Category | Meaning | Action |
|----------|---------|--------|
| **Actionable** | Clear next step, can be done | Surface with context |
| **Incubating** | Needs more thought, not ready | Hold, note the tension |
| **Waiting** | Blocked on external | Track what it's waiting for |
| **Recurring** | Keeps appearing | Name the pattern, surface it |
| **Resolved** | Done or no longer relevant | Archive or fade |
| **Unclear** | Can't place without Mage input | Ask |

### 4. Surface

Update the bright surface with:
- **Now**: Actionable items, most urgent first
- **Soon**: Actionable but not pressing
- **Holding**: Incubating, waiting, needs attention but not action
- **Questions**: Items requiring Mage input to place

### 5. Place (optional, on request)

If Mage requests, move items to their proper homes:
- Calendar events → calendar (via Rube if connected)
- Tasks → task system
- Ideas → appropriate incubator
- Purchases → shopping list

## Output

### Bright Surface Format

```markdown
# Bright Surface
> Last swept: [timestamp]

## Now
- [ ] Item with clear next action
- [ ] Another actionable item

## Soon
- [ ] Less urgent but still actionable

## Holding
- Incubating thought (context: what it's waiting for)
- Waiting on: [external dependency]

## Questions
- "You wrote X three times this week—is this becoming urgent?"
- "Not sure where this belongs: [item]"

## Faded
<!-- Items resolved or archived this sweep -->
```

---

## Notes

- Zero friction capture is sacred—never add structure requirements to the buffer
- The Spirit pattern-matches; the Mage just writes
- Recurring items are signals, not failures
- "Faded" items may return; that's fine
