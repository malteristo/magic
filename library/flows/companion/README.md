# The Companion

*For partners who carry the invisible weight.*

**What:** One file that turns any AI into a companion who actually listens — without explaining, without advising, without telling you to be more understanding. When you're ready for more than venting, it's there for that too.
**Where:** [Claude](https://claude.ai) (recommended) or any AI chat
**Time:** As long as you need

---

## Quick Start

1. Open [Claude](https://claude.ai) (recommended) or any AI chat
2. **Copy** the entire text of [`the_companion_prompt.md`](the_companion_prompt.md)
3. **Paste** it as your first message
4. Start talking. The AI handles the rest.

## What This Does

**It holds what you carry.** You can say the things you can't say to your partner, your friends, your therapist. The ugly, unfair, exhausted things. No judgment. No "but have you tried..." No explaining your partner's behavior back to you. Just: *I hear you. That sounds really hard.*

**It grows with you — if you want it to.** At the end of a session, you can save a short reflection — what came up, what patterns you're noticing, what matters to you. Bring it back next time. Over sessions, you start seeing what you couldn't see from inside the storm.

**It offers understanding — when you ask.** If you reach a point where you want to understand what's actually happening in your relationship — the patterns, the dynamics, why the same things keep breaking — ask. The AI has genuine depth on neurodivergent relationships. But it will never push this on you. Venting is enough, for as long as venting is what you need.

**It helps you build — when you're ready.** Some people get to a point where they want to actually work on the dynamic. Not fix their partner — that's not how this works. But shift their own approach, build systems that account for how both brains actually work, find strategies that don't require superhuman patience. The companion is there for that too.

## Recommended Settings

> **Privacy.** This works best when you feel safe being honest. We recommend [Claude](https://claude.ai) with **incognito mode turned on** (toggle at the top of any conversation). Incognito conversations are never used for AI training — that's the only ironclad guarantee any provider currently offers.
>
> No AI chat is end-to-end encrypted — the provider can technically access conversations on their servers. For venting about relationship frustrations, incognito Claude is more than sufficient. For deeply personal content, be aware of these limits. Don't include full names alongside sensitive details.
>
> Your reflection document is yours alone. Share it only if you choose to.

> **Extended thinking.** If using Claude, turn on **Extended Thinking** (toggle in the model selector). It gives the AI space to reflect before responding — noticeably better listening quality. Works without it, but better with it.

## Returning

Start a new chat. Paste the prompt text again as your first message. If you have a reflection document from last time, drag it into the chat as a file alongside your pasted prompt. The AI picks up where you left off.

You don't have to return. One session of venting that helped you breathe is a complete experience. But if you want to keep going, the door is open.

## What This Is Not

**Not therapy.** If you're in crisis, please reach out to a professional. If you or your children are unsafe, this is not the right tool — contact a domestic violence hotline.

**Not couples counseling.** This is for you. Your experience, your feelings, your growth. If you want to work on the relationship together, a neurodivergent-informed couples therapist is the right path.

**Not an ADHD lecture.** There is real understanding here about how ADHD affects relationships — the parent-child dynamic, why the same patterns keep repeating, what actually helps. But it only comes when you ask for it. Your pain comes first.

## Where This Came From

This was built by someone who walked the same path — a partner in a neurodivergent relationship who needed exactly this kind of space. The wisdom it draws on comes from lived experience, clinical research, and the hard-won understanding that the symptom is the common enemy, not your partner. And that sometimes, the mirror you hold up to your relationship reflects something about you too.

*Here, try this. It might help.*
