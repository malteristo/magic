# The Question Underneath

**The Thread — portable practice prompt**

## What This Is

A single-paste practice for anyone who feels stuck, lost, or disconnected from what they actually want.

Not therapy. Not a framework. A conversation.

The practice surfaces the question you're actually asking right now — the one running underneath the surface — helps you answer it genuinely, and asks you to write down one line: the question and your decision in response. That entry is the beginning of a record. The record is what accumulates.

## Who It's For

Anyone who:
- Feels like they've lost the thread of their own life
- Is going through the motions but something feels off
- Can't quite name what's wrong — or what they actually want
- Is making decisions, but they don't feel like *their* decisions

No prior experience needed. No frameworks to understand. Paste and talk.

## How to Use It

1. Open [Claude](https://claude.ai) (recommended) or any capable AI
2. Turn on **Extended Thinking** if available
3. **Drag** `the_thread_prompt.md` into the chat, or **paste** its contents
4. Start talking — the AI takes it from there

A session runs its natural course — usually 20–40 minutes. It ends when you've written down one entry.

---

## What It Produces

One chronicle entry:

```
[Date] — Question: [the question you're actually asking]. Decision: [your genuine response].
```

Save it in your notes, your journal, wherever feels right. It belongs to you.

If you come back — whether tomorrow or six months from now — bring the entry. The practice reads where you were and begins fresh from where you are.

## The Logic Behind It

Most conversations about being lost start with answers: what to do, how to reframe, what to try. This practice starts with the question.

The working hypothesis is this: when someone feels disconnected from meaning, the problem is usually not that they lack answers. It's that they've stopped genuinely asking. The questions that used to generate their decisions — that shaped what they noticed and what they moved toward — have gone quiet or become inaudible. They're responding to everyone else's questions but not their own.

Finding the question doesn't solve it. But the recognition — *this is what I've been asking* — seems to be meaningful in its own right. And the decision that follows, however small, is the beginning of genuine participation.

Decision by decision, those entries accumulate. Over time, the pattern becomes visible: what you were actually asking, what you actually chose. That accumulation is the thread.

## Privacy

The most private option: use Claude with **incognito mode** on (toggle at the top). Incognito conversations are never used for AI training.

No AI chat is end-to-end encrypted. For everyday topics this is more than sufficient; for highly sensitive content, be aware of these limits.

Your entry belongs to you. Share it only if you choose to.

## The Second Front Door

The Companion helps people who are carrying something specific — a relationship, a dynamic, a recurring weight.

The Thread is for the earlier question: *what am I actually asking?* It works for anyone, at any time, regardless of what's happening. It's the practice before the practice — the conversation that orients you to your own compass before anything else.
