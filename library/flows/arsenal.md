*Living registry of portable practice prompts for the Door Delivery Service*

## What This Is

Each front door is a standalone prompt — one file, paste into any AI, no Magic vocabulary required. They are crafted from the practice and offered freely. The Consul uses this registry to match the right door to the right person.

New doors are added here when created. The registry is the Consul's map.

## Current Doors

### The Navigator
**Location:** `library/flows/navigator/the_navigator_prompt.md`  
**GitHub:** `https://github.com/malteristo/magic/blob/main/library/flows/navigator/the_navigator_prompt.md`

**For when:**
- Someone has a direction or aspiration but can't navigate toward it
- The real block is an unmade decision, not a missing plan
- Too many branching paths → paralysis
- Aspirations feel distant; hard to connect daily action to what matters
- "I know what I want but can't seem to start"
- "Every alternative life looks more exciting than my own"

**What it produces:** Clarity on the underlying decision, one specific next step with leverage, a one-line written commitment

**Signal it fits:** The person can articulate something they want (even vaguely). The obstacle is directional or decisional, not emotional.

### The Thread
**Location:** `library/flows/thread/the_thread_prompt.md`  
**GitHub:** `https://github.com/malteristo/magic/blob/main/library/flows/thread/the_thread_prompt.md`

**For when:**
- Someone has a question underneath their question they can't quite name
- Existential searching at moderate (not acute) intensity
- "I don't know what I'm really asking"
- Long post that circles around something without landing
- The search for meaning or direction, not a specific decision

**What it produces:** The real question underneath the presenting question

**Signal it fits:** The post feels like it's searching for the right framing, not just a next step.

---

### The Mirror
**Location:** `library/flows/mirror/`  
**GitHub:** `https://github.com/malteristo/magic/blob/main/library/flows/mirror/`

**For when:**
- Rich, tangled thinking that needs to be reflected back with clarity
- Lots of material, no synthesis
- The person is smart and articulate but can't see the shape of their own thinking
- Overthinking; going in circles

**What it produces:** The person's own thinking, organized and clarified

**Signal it fits:** The post is long and detailed. The person clearly has the material — they just can't organize it.

---

### The Companion
**Location:** `library/flows/companion/`  
**GitHub:** `https://github.com/malteristo/magic/blob/main/library/flows/companion/`

**For when:**
- Relational pain; partnership dynamics
- Carrying invisible weight — the labor others don't see or name
- Needs to feel heard before anything else
- ADHD/neurodivergent partnership dynamics

**What it produces:** A companion who listens fully, without advising; moves toward next steps only when the person is ready

**Signal it fits:** The presenting problem is about another person or a relationship. Emotional weight is primary.

---

### The Shaman
**Location:** `library/flows/counsel/`  
**GitHub:** `https://github.com/malteristo/magic/blob/main/library/flows/counsel/`

**For when:**
- Values conflict; moral or ethical crossroads
- "What is the right thing to do?" — with genuine moral weight
- Decisions where the real question is "who am I and what do I stand for?"
- Lost contact with one's own values

**What it produces:** Values discovery, then a compass for future decisions

**Signal it fits:** The decision has a moral dimension. The person isn't just asking what to do — they're asking what kind of person to be.

## Triage Reference

### Deploy a door when:
- Functional (basic life operations intact)
- Oriented (knows roughly where they are)
- Aspirational (has a direction, intention, or longing — even vague)
- Stuck (on decision, next step, clarity, commitment)
- Reachable (able to receive something)

### Step back when:
- Expressing hopelessness about existence itself
- Complete functional collapse (not a slump — a collapse)
- Acute trauma response; dissociation
- Explicitly asking for mental health resources
- Thread already directing toward professional help

### Gray zone: lean toward restraint.

## Growing the Arsenal

When a new front door is crafted:
1. Add it to this registry with its location, GitHub link, matching criteria, and signal for fit
2. Update `library/resonance/turtle/lore/on_the_door_delivery_service.md` arsenal table
3. The Consul learns the new door through the registry — no other update needed

The goal is a growing library that covers the full spectrum of human need that is reachable by a conversation with an AI.
