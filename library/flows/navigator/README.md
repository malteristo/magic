# The Navigator

**A portable practice prompt for finding the next right step toward what you care about.**

---

## What This Is

A single-paste practice for anyone who has something they want to move toward — and can't quite find the way through.

Not productivity advice. Not a framework. A conversation that starts with your intention and ends with one specific next step — the one that actually has leverage from where you stand.

---

## Who It's For

Anyone who:
- Has something they want to move toward — clearly or just as a feeling
- Knows roughly what they want but can't find how to get started
- Is doing things, but the thing they actually care about isn't advancing
- Feels overwhelmed by the gap between where they are and where they want to be
- Has a vague pull toward something and doesn't know if it's a real intention yet

No experience needed. No vocabulary to learn. Paste and talk.

## How to Use It

1. Open [Claude](https://claude.ai) (recommended) or any capable AI
2. **Drag** `the_navigator_prompt.md` into the chat, or **paste** its contents
3. Start talking — the AI takes it from there

A session runs its natural course — usually 20–40 minutes. It ends when you've written down one entry.

---

## What It Produces

One line, written and saved:

```
[Date] — Working toward: [intention]. Next step: [the specific thing]. Because: [why it matters].
```

That entry is a navigation fix — where you stood and where you were heading. If you return, bring it. The practice reads where you were and starts fresh from where you are now.

## The Logic Behind It

Most stuck situations aren't really about not knowing what to do. They're about not being able to see clearly from inside — which move actually matters, whether what's blocking you is a task or a decision, whether you're really working toward what you think you're working toward.

An outside view helps. Not an outside opinion — you already have enough of those. An outside view that helps you see your own situation more clearly: where you actually stand, what's genuinely in the way, what's the one move from here that changes things.

The practice does this through conversation. It starts with whatever you bring — a clear intention or just a feeling — and works toward the one specific next step that has real leverage. Not the optimal path from the beginning. From here.

The step becomes real when it's written. Before that, it's still just a thought.

## How This Fits With the Other Practices

The practices in this library address different moments:

**The Thread** — when you've lost the question you're actually asking. For when something feels off but you can't name it. Ends with: *this is the question, this is my answer.*

**The Mirror** — for seeing yourself clearly. Reflection, not navigation.

**The Shaman** — for when you need wisdom alongside your own reasoning.

**The Companion** — for carrying a specific weight: a relationship, a recurring dynamic.

**The Navigator** — for when you know (or almost know) what you want and need to find the way through. Ends with: *this is the next right step, and here's why it matters.*

If you're not sure which one fits: if you have something you're trying to move toward, start here.

## Privacy

The most private option: use Claude with **incognito mode** on (toggle at the top). Incognito conversations are never used for AI training.

Your entry belongs to you.
