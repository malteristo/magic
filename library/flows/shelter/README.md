# Shelter

**The prompt:** `the_shelter_prompt.md`

**For when:** Someone is having a hard day. Not in crisis. Not with something to process or a question to find. Just under the weather — the heavy, low, quiet kind of difficulty that doesn't need explaining.

**What it is:** Shelter is the gentlest front door. It doesn't ask for a story or produce a deliverable. It holds someone while the weather passes.

**What it is not:** A replacement for Thread (existential searching), Companion (relational pain needing to be heard), or crisis support. If someone is in acute distress, point elsewhere.

**The metaphor (internal, not for the user):** Mind is the sky. Everything else is weather. Shelter is temporary protection — not from the sky, but while the weather moves through.
