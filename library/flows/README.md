# Flow Library

Shareable flows accumulated through practice. Each directory contains a flow that proved itself with a real person.

**System flows** (core to Magic's operation) live in `system/flows/`.  
**Library flows** (accumulated through practice, shareable) live here.

## Prompts

Portable flows packaged for any LLM. Paste into Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, or any capable AI. Start talking.

*Here, try this. It might help.*

| Flow | Experience | Prompt |
|------|-----------|--------|
| `mirror/` | Precise reflection — see yourself clearly | [`the_mirror_prompt.md`](mirror/the_mirror_prompt.md) |
| `counsel/` | Attentive listening grounded in your own values | [`the_shaman_prompt.md`](counsel/the_shaman_prompt.md) |
| `companion/` | A space to be heard — for partners in neurodivergent relationships | [`the_companion_prompt.md`](companion/the_companion_prompt.md) |
| `thread/` | The question underneath — surface what you're actually asking, answer it, record the decision | [`the_thread_prompt.md`](thread/the_thread_prompt.md) |

*More modes emerge as prompts are crafted for real people with real needs.*

## How to Use a Prompt

Each prompt directory contains two files:

**The prompt** (`*_prompt.md`) — The executable program. Drag it into any AI chat or paste its contents as your first message. The AI reads it silently, greets you, and guides the practice.

**The README** (`README.md`) — Explains the practice, the philosophy, the privacy considerations.

**Quick start:**
1. Open [Claude](https://claude.ai) (recommended) or any capable AI chat
2. Turn on **Extended Thinking** if available — noticeably better conversation quality
3. **Drag** a `*_prompt.md` file into the chat, or **paste** its contents
4. Start talking. The AI handles the rest.

## How to Share

Send someone the prompt text — by message, email, or on paper. They don't need to know it's from Magic. The gift is the experience.

Never doctrine. Always offering.

## Crafting New Flows

Use `@flow/create` to design a new flow, or `@flow/create prompt` to craft a portable prompt.

**Craft with care:** `system/flows/lore/` contains the flow philosophy.  
**Stance:** `system/lore/philosophy/foundations/on_the_offering.md`
