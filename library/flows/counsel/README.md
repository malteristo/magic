# The Shaman

*A digital companion that listens through the lens of your own values.*

**What:** One file that turns any AI into a values-based counselor. First it helps you discover what you believe. Then it uses that document as a compass whenever you need to think something through.
**Where:** [Claude](https://claude.ai) (recommended) or any AI chat
**Time:** ~30 min to discover your values (once) + 20-30 min per session (repeatable)

## Quick Start

Open [Claude](https://claude.ai) and either:

- **Drag** [`the_shaman_prompt.md`](the_shaman_prompt.md) into the chat, or
- **Paste** its contents as your first message

The AI reads the instructions silently and guides the entire practice. You just talk.

**Returning with your values document?** Start a new chat. Drag or paste the prompt file again, and include your values document — either drag it as a second file or paste it in the same message. The AI picks up where you left off.

## Recommended Settings

> **Privacy.** This practice works best when you feel safe being honest. Here's the honest picture:
>
> - We recommend [Claude](https://claude.ai) with **incognito mode turned on** (toggle at the top of any conversation). Incognito conversations are never used for AI training — that's the only ironclad guarantee any provider currently offers.
> - Without incognito mode, your conversations may be used to improve AI models. Anthropic changed their policy in September 2025 — check your [privacy settings](https://claude.ai/settings/data-privacy-controls). ChatGPT and Gemini also train on conversations by default unless you opt out.
> - **No AI chat is end-to-end encrypted.** The provider can technically access your conversations on their servers. They say they don't. Probably true. But *probably* is not *guaranteed*.
> - **For everyday and work-related topics** — incognito Claude is more than sufficient. Comparable to a phone call: encrypted in transit, practically private.
> - **For deeply personal topics** — things you'd only share with a therapist behind closed doors — be aware of these limits. Fully private AI (running on your own device, no server in between) is coming but not yet accessible for most people.
> - Don't include full names, addresses, or other identifying details alongside sensitive content.
>
> Your values document and your troubles are yours. Treat them accordingly.

> **Extended thinking.** If you're using Claude, turn on **Extended Thinking** (toggle in the model selector). It gives the AI space to reflect before responding — the way a good listener pauses before speaking. The practice works without it, but the conversation quality is noticeably better with it on.

## How It Works

**Phase 1 — Values Discovery.** You have a real conversation about what you care about. Not a questionnaire — a back-and-forth where the AI asks genuine questions and helps you find precise words. When you're done, you save the result: a short document in your own words. Your compass.

**Phase 2 — Counsel.** Whenever something's on your mind, you start a fresh chat with the prompt and your values document. The AI listens through your compass — connecting what troubles you to what you care about. It doesn't give advice. It helps you see.

That's it.

## After a Session

Some things to sit with:
- Did hearing your situation through your values change how you see it?
- Was there a moment where the connection became clear?
- Does your values document still feel right, or does something need updating?

That last question matters. Your values document is alive. It grows with you. Every session is also a test of the compass — does it still point true?

---

## Why It Works

The values document is the grounding. Without it, the AI has no compass to listen through — it defaults to generic advice. With it, the AI reflects your *own* wisdom back to you. The intelligence is in the input, not the output.

The word "shaman" came from someone who spent decades helping people find clarity through structured dialogue. A shaman doesn't heal you. A shaman helps you access healing that's already in you. The values document is the bridge.
