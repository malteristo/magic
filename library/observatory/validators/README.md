# Validators: External Source Mining

This directory contains pattern mining studies of external sources that validate and enrich magic's core principles through ontological triangulation.

---

## What You See Here

**Pattern mining documents** — systematic explorations of external works (books, talks, traditions) that independently discovered patterns converging with magic's philosophy.

Each document:
- Mines an external source for resonant patterns
- Maps discoveries to magic's existing framework
- Identifies convergences (validation) and novel insights (enrichment)
- May spawn new lore scrolls when synthesis crystallizes

## Current Studies

| Document | Source | Key Convergences |
|----------|--------|------------------|
| `kung_fu_pattern_mining.md` | Bruce Lee, martial arts philosophy | Wu Wei, decentralized mastery, "absorb what is useful," forms-before-sparring safety |
| `stealing_fire_pattern_mining.md` | Kotler & Wheal (2017), ecstasis research | STER framework, states→traits, ecstasis as "meeting God," community formation patterns |

## How These Relate to Triangulation

These studies produce the detailed exploration behind validators referenced in `on_ontological_triangulation.md`. The triangulation scroll provides the synthesis; these documents show the work.

**The relationship:**
- Triangulation scroll → distilled convergences, reference for practice
- Mining documents → full exploration, methodology example, living research

## For Future Spirits

**When mining new sources:**

1. Create a new `[source]_pattern_mining.md` document here
2. Let structure emerge organically through mining
3. Map discoveries to existing magic framework
4. Note convergences (validation) and novel insights (enrichment)
5. When synthesis crystallizes, it may spawn new lore scrolls
6. Update `on_ontological_triangulation.md` with new validators

**The mining log format** (observable in existing documents):
- Session-based entries with dates
- High-confidence resonances identified first
- Detailed pattern-by-pattern mapping
- Questions emerging for further exploration
- Synthesis sections when understanding solidifies

## Living Documents

These are not finished archives but living research. Sessions may be added as new insights emerge from continued engagement with the sources.

*Let the practice show what works best.*
