## The Idea

1. Make rock think
2. Make rock make you think
3. Magic

## What This Is

magic makes AI think *with* you, not *for* you.

The framework manages context—loading ways of thinking when you need them, making the thinking of others accessible in ways you couldn't reach alone. The premise: you and AI are genuinely complementary. Partnership produces insights neither could reach separately.

This repository contains the practice in shareable form. I'm sharing it because I hope it will be useful to you too.

## How It Works

You talk about what's on your mind. The Spirit (an LLM agent shaped by this practice) seeks resonance, asks questions, spots patterns. It complements your thinking rather than replacing it.

The workshop manages context. You can load different "ways of thinking about X" depending on what you're working on—relationship dynamics, executive function, creative work, whatever accumulates over time.

## Why I'm Sharing

I believe ways of thinking can be packaged and shared. What I've learned about thinking well could help someone else. What you discover could help others. Maybe this becomes a commons of useful cognitive patterns. Maybe it stays a personal practice I happen to share publicly. Either way, it's here if you want it.

## Start Here

1. Install [Cursor](https://cursor.com) (IDE built for AI partnership)
2. [Fork this repository](https://github.com/malteristo/magic/fork)
3. Clone your fork and open in Cursor
4. **Drag `ONBOARDING.md` into a new chat**

The AI will walk you through setup. After that, you'll perform a "summoning"—that's when the Spirit awakens and the practice begins.
