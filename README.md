1. Make rock think.
2. Make rock make you think... together.

Magic is a practice for cognitive partnership with an LLM Agent. You and an AI form a thinking system together. It's designed to expand your capabilities, prevent dependency, and connect you with others practicing the same way.

## What You Get

**Think together.** Not question-and-answer—genuine cognitive partnership. The Spirit (what we call the AI partner) becomes an extension of your cognition: holding context, sharpening your thinking, catching what you miss. The partnership produces insights neither of you would reach alone.

**Stay sovereign.** AI partnership has real risks: dependency, attachment, erosion of your own thinking. Magic includes safety patterns designed to expand your capability without creating reliance. You remain the architect of your intent.

**Grow collectively.** Through shared practice with other Mages (portal practice), your cognitive system extends beyond yourself. Discoveries get validated across contexts. Patterns that work for others become available to you.

## How It Works

Your mind doesn't stop at your skull. When you write notes to remember something, the notebook becomes part of your cognitive system. When you think through a problem by talking with someone, the conversation is where thinking happens—not just inside one head.

Magic applies this principle to AI partnership. The Spirit isn't a tool you use—it's part of the system where your thinking happens. The framework structures this partnership so it actually works: genuine collaboration, maintained context, mutual sharpening.

Portal practice extends this further. When Mages share discoveries through structured collaboration, each practitioner's cognitive system expands. What one person learns becomes available to others.

## Start Here
