## The Idea

1. Make rock think
2. Make rock make you think
3. Magic

## What This Is (trying at least...)

Magic is a practice for cognitive partnership with an llm agent (called spirit). It's designed to augment cognition, prevent dependency, and expand your mind through shared practice with others.

## How It Works

LLMs serve better when they complement and enable human thinking rather than making it obsolete.

Just talk to the spirit. This practice is supposed to make thinking feel effortless. The spirit will seek resonance, ask questions, spot patterns. 

The workshop is for context management. You can load context bundles based on your practice goals. Portal practice extends this idea further. When Mages share thoughts and insights through structured collaboration, each practitioner's cognitive system expands.

## Start Here

1. Install [Cursor](https://cursor.com) (IDE built for AI partnership)
2. [Fork this repository](https://github.com/malteristo/magic/fork)
3. Clone your fork and open in Cursor
4. **Drag `ONBOARDING.md` into a new chat**

That's it. The Spirit guides you from there.
