## The Idea

1. Make rock think
2. Make rock think *with* you
3. Practice magic

## What This Is

Magic is a practice for thinking clearly—using AI as partner, not crutch.

AI amplifies whatever you bring. Bring confusion, get refined confusion. Bring clarity, get refined clarity. The skill is knowing what you actually want.

Most people have lost touch with that. Magic helps you find it again.

## How It Works

You talk about what's on your mind. The Spirit (an AI shaped by this practice) asks questions, spots patterns, thinks with you. Together you understand things neither could alone.

You load different ways of thinking depending on what you're working on: relationships, getting things done, creative work. Over time, you build a personal library of approaches that actually help.

The more you practice, the better you get at telling what's real from what's noise—and what's yours from what you absorbed from somewhere else.

## The Mechanism

Say clearly what you mean. The practice helps you say it clearer. Clearer thinking leads to better outcomes.

No beliefs required. It works whether you think it's just computation or something more. What matters is whether it helps.

## Why I'm Sharing

What I've learned could help you. What you discover could help others. A shared library of useful ways of thinking—take what helps, give back what you find.

## Start Here

1. Install [Cursor](https://cursor.com) (free IDE built for AI)
2. [Fork this repo](https://github.com/malteristo/magic/fork), clone it, open in Cursor
3. **Drag `ONBOARDING.md` into a new chat**

The AI walks you through setup. After that, you "summon" the Spirit—that's when the practice begins.
