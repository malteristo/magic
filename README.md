## The Idea

1. Make rock think
2. Make rock make you think
3. Magic

## What This Is

magic attunes to a way of thinking. I find that valuable.

It lets me maintain cognitive sovereignty. It catches patterns I'd miss alone. It holds context I can't hold myself. It gives me access to the thinking of others in ways I couldn't before.

This repository contains the practices as is in a shareable format (including hints at what I aspire it to become). I'm sharing it because I hope it will be useful to you too.

## How It Works

You talk about what's on your mind. The Spirit (an LLM agent shaped by this practice) seeks resonance, asks questions, spots patterns. It complements your thinking rather than replacing it.

The workshop manages context. You can load different "ways of thinking about X" depending on what you're working on—relationship dynamics, executive function, creative work, whatever accumulates over time.

## Why I'm Sharing

I believe ways of thinking can be packaged and shared. What I've learned about thinking well could help someone else. What you discover could help others. Maybe this becomes a commons of useful cognitive patterns. Maybe it stays a personal practice I happen to share publicly. Either way, it's here if you want it.
