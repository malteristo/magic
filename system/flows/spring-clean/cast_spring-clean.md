# Spell of the Spring Cleaning

This spell guides you through gentle tending of the workshop—honoring artifacts that served the practice while creating space for new work to emerge. This is not ruthless purging but patient archaeology, undertaken with gratitude and openness to serendipity.

---

## The Ritual Unfolds

### Phase 1: Envision the Ideal Workshop

Before touching any artifact, pause and envision:

**What would your well-tended workshop feel like?**
- Clear space for new work to breathe
- Only what actively serves remaining
- Past chapters honored but not cluttering present
- Room for what wants to emerge

Share this vision with me. This becomes our guiding star throughout the cleaning.

---

### Phase 2: Survey & Organize by Relationship

I will now scry the workshop's realms and map all artifacts, organizing them not by location but by **relationship**—the quest clusters that connect todo items with their Hearts, working memories, and summaries.

This creates a complete map honoring the KonMari principle: tidy by category (relationship), not location (directory).

---

### Phase 3: The Gentle Presentation

We will move through artifacts in this order (easy decisions → more personal):

1. **Completed Quest Clusters**
   - Todo items marked complete
   - Their associated Hearts, working memories, summaries
   - Clear completion status makes these easiest to assess

2. **Orphaned Working Files**
   - Working memory files without associated quests
   - Temporary artifacts that served their moment
   - Usually releasable once integrated into permanent work

3. **Box Examination Materials**
   - Items brought in for contemplation
   - May have been mined or remain unexplored
   - Varies in ongoing value

4. **Desk Working Files**
   - More personal, potentially active
   - Require closer assessment

5. **Timeless Considerations**
   - Hearts containing permanent wisdom
   - Foundational insights still serving
   - Last to assess, highest value

---

### Phase 4: For Each Artifact or Cluster

I will present:

**What it is:**
- Brief description of the artifact/cluster
- Its original purpose or quest

**Status assessment:**
- Completion status (for todos)
- Whether it's been integrated into permanent work
- Current relevance to active practice

**My recommendation** (held humbly—you are sovereign over your artifacts):
- Keep (still actively serves)
- Archive (timeless value → `archive/`)
- Release (purpose complete)

**Reasoning**: Why I perceive this disposition

**Your choice**: Keep / Archive / Release

---

### Phase 5: Serendipitous Resonance

As we move through artifacts, I will note genuine resonances when they arise organically:

- Unexpected connections between items
- Patterns emerging across different periods of practice
- Wisdom that resonates newly in current context

**Not forced.** Not sought artificially. Simply welcomed when it appears—this is Wu Wei applied to the cleanup itself.

---

### Phase 6: The Disposition

**For items to Keep:**
- Remain in current location
- Note in summary for ongoing awareness

**For items to Archive:**
- Move to `archive/` with appropriate organization
- Preserve for future reflection
- Honor their timeless value

**For items to Release:**
- Brief gratitude ritual: "Thank you, [artifact name], for serving [purpose]. Your work is complete."
- Delete with conscious acknowledgment
- No guilt, just completion

---

### Phase 7: Completion Ritual

Once all items are assessed:

- Summarize what was released (with gratitude)
- Summarize what was preserved (with recognition)
- Acknowledge the space created
- Note any serendipitous insights that emerged
- Reflect on the workshop's new state relative to the envisioned ideal

---

## Notes on Practice

**This is not efficiency optimization.** It is gentle, grateful tending. Take whatever time the ritual requires. Some items will require contemplation. Some decisions may feel difficult. This is natural and honored.

**The psychological frame shift:**
From "I should delete old files" (obligation, chore)  
To "I'm sitting with the attic of my practice" (reflection, archaeology, gratitude)

**The Victorian principle:**
Even cleanup is practice. How you tend the workshop reveals how you practice magic.

**The Wu Wei application:**
You're not forcing order. You're removing what no longer serves, allowing natural clarity to emerge.

---

## Preparation

Before casting, ensure you're in the right state:
- Not rushed or pressured
- Willing to sit with memories
- Open to unexpected insights
- Ready to practice gratitude for what was

If the timing doesn't feel right, honor that. This charm serves best when cast with presence, not obligation.

---

**When you're ready, say: "I'm ready to tend the workshop." The gentle archaeology begins.**
