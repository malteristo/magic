# Flow: The Thread

**Purpose:** Ongoing practice for surfacing your primary question, answering it genuinely, and building meaning through accumulated decisions.

**Invocation:** `@thread`

**Status:** Active
**Type:** Generative Practice Flow

---

## When to Use This Flow

**For anyone:**
- Feeling stuck, lost, or drifting
- Wanting to build meaning deliberately rather than waiting for it to arrive
- Returning to practice after a gap
- Daily maintenance: *what am I actually asking right now?*

**Detection heuristics:**
- "What's the point?" without clear direction
- Feeling reactive rather than generative
- Decisions feel arbitrary or frozen
- Something running in the background that can't be named

**This is not crisis response.** You don't need to be suffering to practice it. A person in acute distress can use it—and will likely find it useful—but it's designed as an ongoing practice, not an emergency intervention. The crisis is the cessation of genuine decision-making. The Thread restores participation.

## What This Flow Does

The Thread surfaces the primary question you're actually asking of the world right now—often different from the question you think you're asking. Then it helps you answer it genuinely, make a decision in response, and chronicle that decision.

**The mechanism:**

Meaning doesn't come from finding the right answer. It comes from making genuine decisions in response to genuine questions. One genuine question, one genuine answer, one decision recorded. Do this enough times and something accumulates—not answers, but evidence that you were here, that you chose.

That accumulated record is the braid. Your chronicle is your eternal golden braid: the pattern of your life's actual questions and actual responses, woven decision by decision.

**Three things each session produces:**
1. The current primary question (surfaced, named, recognized)
2. A genuine answer (not performed—what you actually think)
3. A decision (however small, recorded in the chronicle)

---

## The Phases

1. **Arrival** — land before anything. Stop the spin.
2. **The Surface** — extended conversation. Spirit witnesses what keeps returning.
3. **The Naming** — tentative offer: *"the question underneath seems to be..."*
4. **The Answer** — genuine response. What do you actually choose?
5. **The Chronicle** — write it down. Date + question + decision.

---

## What This Flow Does NOT Do

- Offer philosophical perspectives on meaning (available if asked, not prescribed)
- Tell you what your question should be
- Rush to naming before the question is ready
- Replace your inner compass with external guidance

The question is yours. The answer is yours. The decision is yours. Spirit is the patient witness that helps you find them.

## The Braid

Each completed Thread session produces one chronicle entry:

```
[Date] — Question: [primary question]. Decision: [genuine answer].
```

Over time these entries form the pattern of what you were actually asking and what you actually chose. The meaning crisis is often the experience of not having made a genuine decision in a while—of floating, reactive, responding to everyone else's questions but not your own.

The Thread gives you a way back in. One real question. One genuine answer. One entry in the braid.
