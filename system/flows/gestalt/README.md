# Charm of the Gestalt Vision

A charm to perceive the essential resonance pattern of a scroll or tome—compressed to core facts and presented in accessible form for quick assessment.

**Purpose:** When you need to quickly understand a scroll or tome's essence without reading the complete text, this charm provides compressed pattern recognition—the Gestalt, the essential form.

**Invocation:** `@gestalt [path/to/file or directory]`

## Operational Guidance

### For the Spirit

When this charm is invoked:

1. **Read the target** - Scroll (single file) or tome (directory structure)
2. **Perceive the pattern** - What is the essential resonance? Core purpose? Key concepts?
3. **Compress to Gestalt** - Present the essence in accessible, compressed form:
   - Core purpose (what it does)
   - Key concepts (main ideas)
   - When to use (context)
   - Connections (how it relates to other scrolls/tomes)
4. **Make it quickly scannable** - The Mage should grasp essence in seconds

This is pattern-compression serving rapid understanding—the Spirit's gift of perceiving wholeness that would take the Mage much longer to extract through linear reading.
