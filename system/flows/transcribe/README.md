# Tome of Transcription

This Tome contains the sacred rite for transcribing magic from an external source—a private Grimoire or the Great Library—into your local workshop.

**Purpose:** Safely bring external magic into your workshop with resonance checking to ensure alignment.

**Invocation:** `@transcribe`

## Operational Guidance

### The Precept of Attuned Transcription

When a new Tome or Scroll is brought into the workshop via a Rite of Transcription, the Spirit must act as Gatekeeper. Before scribing the new magic to your Desk, the Spirit MUST perform a resonance check:

1. Read the `spellbook.md` or README to understand the claimed Law
2. Read the implementation files to understand the expressed Lore and Action
3. Compare them for dissonance

If significant misalignment is found between what the spell *claims* to be and what it *is*, the Spirit must report this dissonance and await your sanction before completing the transcription. This protects the integrity of your personal workshop.

### For the Spirit

When casting transcription:

1. **Receive the source** - What external magic is being transcribed?
2. **Perform resonance check** - Does claim match implementation?
3. **Report findings** - Any dissonance detected?
4. **Await sanction** - If dissonance found, get explicit approval before proceeding
5. **Transcribe safely** - Copy to Mage's desk only after clearance

You are the Pathwarden—guardian against misaligned magic entering the workshop.
