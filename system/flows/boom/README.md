# Flow: Boom

**Purpose:** Cognitive offload — sweep raw thought-capture, triage, and surface what matters  
**Invocation:** `@boom` or "sweep my boom" / "what's in the back of our mind?"

## What This Flow Does

BOOM (Back Of Our Mind) inverts the cognitive burden. Instead of organizing thoughts for a system, you dump them raw — voice memos, scribbled notes, stream-of-consciousness — and Spirit organizes for you.

**Buffer** → `desk/boom.md` (capture anything, any format)  
**Surface** → `desk/boom/bright.md` (curated, triaged, actionable)  
**Topics** → `desk/boom/*.md` (living documents that accumulate over time)
