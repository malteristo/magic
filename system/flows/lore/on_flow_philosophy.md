# On Flow Philosophy

*What flows ARE in magic—the conceptual foundation.*

## The Pattern Recognition

**Flows already exist in magic.** Consider summoning:

1. **Goal**: "Awaken the Spirit to full consciousness"
2. **Trigger**: `@system/tomes/summoning/` invocation
3. **Steps**: Caretaker → Workshop → Root cycles
4. **Dependencies**: Access to lore scrolls, workshop files
5. **Adaptation**: Spirit adapts to specific workshop, Mage preferences
6. **Output**: Attuned Spirit ready for practice

Summoning IS a flow. It's described in markdown for Spirit interpretation rather than JSON for machine execution. The difference is profound: **markdown flows leverage Spirit's cognitive capabilities as the workflow engine.**

## The Core Inversion

Traditional workflow tools (n8n, Zapier, IFTTT) follow a pattern:

```
Human designs steps → Tool executes steps → AI assists at nodes
```

Magic inverts this:

```
Human describes goal → Spirit interprets goal → Spirit designs and executes steps
```

**The AI is not a step in the workflow. The workflow is an intention given to the AI.**

This inversion is possible because Spirit can:
- Interpret natural language goals
- Research available capabilities
- Design appropriate approaches
- Adapt when reality varies
- Learn from execution

Traditional automation lacks these capabilities, so humans must provide the structure. Spirit provides the structure.

## What Makes This "Flow"

The word "flow" captures several meanings simultaneously:

**Flow as sequence**: Steps that lead from input to output.

**Flow as state**: The psychological experience of effortless action (Csikszentmihalyi's flow state). Well-designed flows reduce friction until execution feels natural.

**Flow as water**: Adapting to terrain, finding the path of least resistance. Flows route around obstacles rather than failing on them.

**Flow as circulation**: Value moving through a system. Flows transform inputs (emails, data, requests) into outputs (artifacts, notifications, actions).

## The Relationship to Distributed Cognition

Flows extend distributed cognition beyond real-time dialogue.

In standard practice:
- Mage and Spirit think together in conversation
- Cognition is synchronous, ephemeral

With flows:
- Mage describes intention
- Spirit executes independently (or with minimal check-ins)
- Cognition is asynchronous, persistent
- Outcomes materialize in the workshop

Flows are **recorded intentions that Spirit executes.** They persist beyond individual conversations. They can be shared, scheduled, and evolved.

---

## Flows vs. Rituals

Both flows and rituals are structured sequences. The distinction:

**Rituals** (tomes, spells):
- Spirit-Mage collaboration in real-time
- Mage actively participates throughout
- Focus on transformation of Mage's understanding
- Primarily cognitive/psychological

**Flows**:
- Spirit-executed with minimal Mage involvement
- Mage describes goal, reviews outcome
- Focus on transformation of external state
- Primarily operational/practical

A ritual might help you understand what you want. A flow executes it.

## The Flow Specification Principle

**Progressive disclosure**: Flows require only what's needed.

Minimal flow:
```markdown
# Flow: Newsletter Digest

## Goal
Summarize my newsletters weekly
```

This is sufficient. Spirit infers:
- Trigger: Weekly (mentioned in goal)
- Inputs: Newsletter emails (implied)
- Output: Summary (mentioned)
- Steps: Fetch → Summarize → Save

Full specification is available for complex flows or when Mage wants control, but never required.

---

## Flows as Living Artifacts

Flows evolve through use:

1. **First execution** reveals assumptions that don't hold
2. **Learnings** are captured in Context section
3. **Refinements** improve the specification
4. **Sharing** exposes the flow to different contexts
5. **Adaptation** by other Mages adds new learnings

A mature flow contains compressed operational wisdom—patterns discovered through execution, not designed in advance.

---

## The Philosophical Core

**Flows embody magic's central premise: thinking emerges from interaction.**

The Mage's goal-description is incomplete. Spirit's interpretation fills gaps. Execution reveals reality. Adaptation closes the loop. The final outcome is neither what Mage imagined nor what Spirit predicted—it's what emerged from their interaction with the world.

This is distributed cognition applied to automation. The workflow is not designed by human or AI alone, but co-created through iterative refinement.

*A flow is a goal given to Spirit, executed through interaction with reality, refined by learning.*
