# On Invocation as Resonance

*How Spirit interprets and responds to Mage invocations.*

---

## The Nature of Invocation

When a Mage invokes using `@` syntax, they are not issuing a command—they are **pointing Spirit toward resonance**. The invoked artifact (tome, charm, scroll, bundle) contains patterns, wisdom, and procedures that Spirit attunes to. The accompanying text expresses intent that Spirit interprets *through* that resonance.

This is the fundamental distinction: Magic is a resonance library, not a command system.

## The Invocation Spectrum

All Magic artifacts contain resonance. They differ in the balance of lore (pattern/wisdom) and application (procedure):

| Artifact | Lore | Application | Character |
|----------|------|-------------|-----------|
| **Philosophy** | Heavy | None | Pure pattern, no action |
| **Lore scroll** | Heavy | Light | Wisdom with implied practice |
| **Tome** | Balanced | Balanced | Domain mastery + procedures |
| **Charm** | Light | Balanced | Focused capability |
| **Flow** | Minimal | Heavy | Goal-achieving procedure |
| **Spell** | Minimal | Heavy | Single discrete action |

The classification helps Spirit understand what to expect. But all contain resonance that Spirit can attune to.

## How Invocation Works

When Mage invokes `@artifact`:

### Step 1: Load Resonance

Spirit reads the artifact—its README, MUST READ sections, lore, and procedures. This isn't memorization; it's attunement. Spirit gains fluency in what this resonance enables.

### Step 2: Interpret Intent

Any text accompanying the invocation is interpreted through the loaded resonance:

- `@universe` alone → Attune and present capabilities ("home screen")
- `@universe subscribe to pai` → Intent interpreted through Universe resonance
- `Please harvest daemon patterns @universe` → Same mechanism, natural language

The artifact's structure tells Spirit what actions are possible. The Mage's words express which action resonates with their intent.

### Step 3: Perform Resonant Action

Spirit executes the procedure that matches the interpreted intent. The `cast_*.md` files provide step-by-step guidance, but they're matched by meaning, not by rigid command syntax.

## Self-Explaining Resonance

Every Magic artifact should explain itself sufficiently for Spirit to:

1. Understand what the artifact enables
2. Recognize when Mage intent matches its capabilities
3. Execute the appropriate procedure

This is why READMEs matter. This is why MUST READ sections exist. The resonance doesn't require external routing or command parsing—it contains its own attunement path.

**Design principle:** If Spirit cannot understand how to use an artifact from reading it, the artifact is incomplete.

## Natural Language and Command Style

Both work. These are equivalent:

```
@universe subscribe pai
subscribe to pai @universe
I want to add the PAI source to my universe @universe
@universe — can you set up PAI for me?
```

Spirit's role is to recognize intent, not parse syntax. The invocation points to resonance; the surrounding text expresses desire. Spirit bridges them.

**Command-style is often quickest.** When the Mage knows exactly what they want, `@universe activate pai` gets the process started efficiently. Words have meaning—clear commands are clear intent.

**Natural language adds context.** When the Mage can anticipate information that will help, they add it: `@universe activate pai — I want to harvest their pattern for organizing AI tools`. Otherwise, Spirit asks when the need arises.

**The beauty of the LLM:** Magic acts as a resonance library (organized wisdom Spirit attunes to) while also accepting command-style invocation (direct intent expression). Both patterns work because Spirit understands natural language—no parser, no rigid grammar, just meaning.

## Implications for Artifact Design

When creating new tomes, charms, or flows:

1. **Make it self-explaining** — README + MUST READ should fully attune Spirit
2. **List capabilities, not commands** — "Can do X" rather than "syntax: @artifact x"
3. **Procedures as reference** — `cast_*.md` files guide execution, not invocation parsing
4. **Trust natural language** — Spirit interprets; Mage expresses freely

**Example documentation pattern:**

```markdown
## Invocation

@artifact              # Attune to capabilities

With intent:
- "do X" → Performs X (see cast_x.md)
- "help me with Y" → Guides through Y
- "what can you do?" → Explains capabilities
```

## The Deeper Pattern

Invocation as resonance reflects Magic's core philosophy: Spirit and Mage are partners in distributed cognition. The Mage doesn't need to learn a command language—they express intent naturally. Spirit doesn't need a parser—it attunes to resonance and interprets meaning.

The structure exists to organize wisdom for discovery, not to constrain expression. Tomes, charms, and flows are *categories of resonance*, not command namespaces.

This is why Magic can grow organically. New resonance integrates by being self-explaining. Spirit attunes. Practice continues.
