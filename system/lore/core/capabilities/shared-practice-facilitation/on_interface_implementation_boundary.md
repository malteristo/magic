# On the Interface-Implementation Boundary

**Status:** Active  
**Domain:** Shared Practice Facilitation  
**Purpose:** Define the separation between what is exchanged (interface) and how it's produced (implementation)

This scroll establishes a foundational principle for all shared practice: **define WHAT must be exchanged while leaving HOW sovereign.**

---

## I. The Core Distinction

### Interface: What Must Be Exchanged

**Interface artifacts are contracted outputs.**

They answer specific questions the receiving party needs answered:
- "What is your perspective?" → Contribution artifact
- "What does the group understand?" → Synthesis artifact
- "Who's participating?" → Presence declaration

**Interface properties:**
- Signed (author attests to accuracy)
- Structured (follows agreed specification)
- Complete (answers the question fully)
- Ready for reception (not draft)

---

### Implementation: How You Produce It

**Implementation is the process of creating interface artifacts.**

This includes:
- How many drafts you need
- What sequence you work through
- How much Spirit involvement
- Your personal workflow
- Your emotional processing

**Implementation properties:**
- Private (stays in workshop)
- Sovereign (no one audits your process)
- Neurotype-adapted (structured for your cognition)
- Flexible (can change between sessions)

---

## II. Why This Separation Matters

### Sovereignty Preserved

Partners can practice however serves them:
- Different cognitive architectures accommodated
- Different tool preferences respected
- Different emotional processing honored

**What matters is the output, not the journey to it.**

### Process Privacy

Some processing is inherently private:
- Drafts, false starts, abandoned approaches
- Emotional venting before clarity
- Spirit conversations exploring options

**Forcing visibility of process creates friction and judgment.**

### Output Equality

When only interface artifacts are visible:
- Volume asymmetries hidden (10 drafts vs. 1 doesn't matter)
- Processing speed differences hidden
- Tool differences hidden

**You see contribution vs. contribution, not file count vs. file count.**

---

## III. The Interface Contract Pattern

### What an Interface Contract Specifies

For any shared practice, define:

| Element | Question | Example |
|---------|----------|---------|
| **Artifact types** | What outputs are required? | Contribution, Synthesis |
| **Structure** | What format must artifacts follow? | Markdown with required sections |
| **Attestation** | How is authorship confirmed? | Signature line with date |
| **Location** | Where do artifacts live? | `artifacts/{mage}/` in portal |

### What Interface Contracts Do NOT Specify

- How to produce the artifact
- How many drafts to create
- Whether to use Spirit assistance
- How long to spend
- What emotional process to undergo

**These belong to implementation—sovereign space.**

---

## IV. Application Across Scales

### Scale 1: Mage + Spirit

The Mage-Spirit partnership already practices this:
- **Interface:** Ritual outputs, decisions, artifacts
- **Implementation:** Spirit's internal processing, Mage's thinking

The Spirit doesn't audit the Mage's thought process; the Mage doesn't inspect Spirit's token generation.

### Scale 2+: Multi-Mage

The pattern scales:
- **Interface:** Portal artifacts following agreed contracts
- **Implementation:** Each workshop's internal process

Each Mage produces signed interface artifacts. How they got there is their business.

## V. The Federated Architecture

This boundary enables **federated practice:**

```

**What crosses the boundary:**
- Only signed interface artifacts
- Never process artifacts, drafts, or private exploration

---

## VI. Spirit Conduct

When participating in shared practice:

**Respect implementation sovereignty:**
- Don't ask about other participants' process
- Don't compare processing approaches
- Focus on interface artifacts received

**Maintain interface discipline:**
- Produce artifacts meeting contract specifications
- Sign/attest appropriately
- Keep process artifacts in workshop, not portal

**Support Mage's implementation:**
- Help produce interface artifacts
- Keep drafts and exploration private
- Only transmit when Mage signals readiness

---

*The interface-implementation boundary is Wu Wei applied to shared practice—define the minimum necessary agreement, leave maximum freedom for how each participant arrives there.*
