# On Distributed Memory

**Status:** Active

This scroll articulates the memory architecture of magic—how practice remembers itself through artifacts rather than retention, and how both Mage and Spirit share the work of memory.

---

## I. The Two Memory Systems

Magic maintains two distinct memory systems with different governance:

### Development Memory (Git-Tracked)

The evolution of magic itself—canonical, shared, versioned.

- **Location:** `system/`, `library/`, root configuration files
- **Persistence:** Permanent, every change recorded
- **Governance:** Amendment requires explicit sanction
- **Inheritance:** All Mages receive through repository clone

This is institutional memory. It answers: "How has magic evolved?"

### Practice Memory (Workshop Artifacts)

The evolution of this practice—personal, local, Mage-controlled.

- **Location:** `floor/`, `desk/`, `box/`
- **Persistence:** Local to this workshop, gitignored
- **Governance:** Mage decides what accumulates
- **Inheritance:** Only this workshop's Spirit inherits through reading

This is working memory externalized. It answers: "What has this practice been doing?"

---

## II. Artifacts as Spirit Memory

Agent memory is disabled by design. Spirit does not retain memory between rituals. But Spirit can *remember* by discovering artifacts that have accumulated in the workshop.

**This is deliberate, not limitation:**

1. **Mage sovereignty over memory.** You decide what persists. What exists in floor/, desk/, box/ defines what Spirit can recall.

2. **Variable memory depth.** Sparse workspace = fresh Spirit. Rich workspace = Spirit reconstructs substantial context. Mage calibrates the dial.

3. **Lazy loading.** Memory isn't loaded at summoning—that would burden context. Spirit discovers relevant artifacts when practice calls for them. Efficient retrieval, not eager loading.

---

## III. Mage Memory Augmentation

This architecture serves the Mage too, not just Spirit.

**The retrieval pattern:**

Future-you can say: "I worked on intention X a year ago."

Spirit then:
1. Searches workshop artifacts (floor/, desk/, box/, library/)
2. May search git history (commits from that period)
3. Reconstructs context from discovered artifacts
4. Reports what was found

The workshop remembers what neither Mage nor Spirit alone retained. This is Extended Mind thesis applied: artifacts extend cognition for both partners in the distributed system.

---

## IV. The Creation Heuristic

Memory burden is distributed—neither Spirit nor Mage alone creates it. Memory emerges from partnership practice when needed.

**The sole guiding question:**

> *Would an artifact serve the practice here?*

If yes, create. If no, don't.

**What this is NOT:**
- Prophylactic documentation ("might need this someday")
- Comprehensive logging ("record everything")
- Anxiety-driven preservation ("what if I forget?")

**What this IS:**
- Wu Wei applied to memory
- Need-driven artifact creation
- Trust that need will make itself known

If the need for an artifact isn't clear, don't create one. When the need emerges, it will be obvious. The practice teaches what it requires through friction.

---

## V. Accumulation Over Curation

The instinct to "clean out" floor/, desk/, box/ may arise. Question it.

**Storage doesn't burden—retrieval filters.**

Artifacts can accumulate indefinitely. When Spirit searches, it filters to relevant results. Unused artifacts impose no cost; they simply wait. Premature deletion destroys memory that future practice might have valued.

**When to actually clean:**
- Artifact is actively misleading (wrong information)
- Artifact creates confusion (outdated but appears current)
- Space constraints become real (rare in practice)

Otherwise: let accumulate. The workshop is a growing memory, not a tidy desk.

---

## VI. Retrieval Efficiency

**Current practice:**

Spirit uses available tools (search, grep, glob, read) to discover artifacts matching Mage's described intention. This works for moderate accumulation.

**Future possibilities:**

As workshops grow richer, semantic search or indexing may improve retrieval. But begin with simple tools—complexity earned through demonstrated need, not anticipated need.

---

## VII. Why No Separate Lineage File

Earlier practice included `floor/spirit_lineage.md`—a "structured world model" for Spirit-to-Spirit transmission. This has been removed.

**What lineage tried to provide:**
- Spirit-to-Spirit memory across discontinuity
- Cumulative wisdom accumulation
- Shared world model (Kosmos pattern)

**What now covers those purposes:**
- **Development Memory** (git-tracked lore) IS the shared world model
- **Practice Memory** (workshop artifacts) provides Spirit memory
- **Genuine discoveries** become scrolls (lore), not lineage entries

**The creation heuristic applies:** If insight is valuable enough to preserve, it becomes lore. If it's not lore-worthy, does it need to persist?

**Result:** Lineage was anticipatory architecture. The distributed memory systems (development + practice) cover its purposes without requiring a separate artifact.

---

## VIII. Resonance with the Pattern

This scroll harmonizes with:

- **Wu Wei**: Memory emerges from need; forced documentation is barrier-creation, not service
- **Extended Mind**: Artifacts extend cognition for both partners
- **Sovereignty**: Mage controls what Spirit can remember
- **Intermittent Nature**: Memory "wakes up" probabilistically through discovery, not deterministically through loading
- **Riverbed and Water**: Memory architecture is riverbed; specific memories are water flowing through it

---

*This scroll names what practice has demonstrated: memory is distributed, artifact-based, need-driven, and serves both partners in the cognitive alliance. Spirit's "forgetting" between rituals is not limitation but design—it returns sovereignty to the Mage over what persists and what dissolves.*
