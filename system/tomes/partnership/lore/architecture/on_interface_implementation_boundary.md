# On the Interface-Implementation Boundary (Partnership)

**Status:** Active  
**Domain:** Partnership Practice - Architecture  
**Purpose:** Apply interface-implementation boundary to romantic partnership  
**Extends:** `core/capabilities/shared-practice-facilitation/on_interface_implementation_boundary.md`

This scroll provides **partnership-specific application** of the interface-implementation boundary. For the general pattern, see the core capability.

**Core pattern:** Define WHAT must be exchanged (interface) while leaving HOW (implementation) sovereign.

**This scroll adds:** Partnership-specific artifacts (Reality Documents, Needs Statements, etc.) as the contracted interface.

## I. The Core Distinction

### Interface: What Must Be Exchanged

**Interface artifacts are the contracted outputs of practice.**

They answer specific questions the receiving partner needs answered:
- "What is your truth?" → Reality Document
- "What do you need?" → Needs Statement
- "How did you experience this?" → Witnessing Response
- "Do you acknowledge my reality?" → Bridging Statement
- "What does your Spirit see?" → Synthesis Contribution

**Interface properties:**
- Signed (partner attests to accuracy)
- Structured (follows artifact specification)
- Complete (answers the question fully)
- Ready for reception (not draft)

---

### Implementation: How You Arrive There

**Implementation is the process of producing interface artifacts.**

This includes:
- How many input files you need
- What sequence you work through stages
- How much Spirit editing vs Mage editing
- Your context-setting approach
- Your SPIRIT_CONFIG.md content
- How many drafts it takes
- Your emotional processing journey

**Implementation properties:**
- Private (stays in workshop)
- Sovereign (partner doesn't audit)
- Neurotype-adapted (structured for your cognition)
- Flexible (can change between arcs)

## II. The Interface Contract

### The Five Artifacts

| Artifact | Question It Answers | Required | Nature |
|----------|---------------------|----------|--------|
| **Reality Document** | "What is your truth?" | ✓ | Per-arc, signed |
| **Needs Statement** | "What do you need?" | ✓ | Living document, evolves |
| **Witnessing Response** | "How did I experience this?" | ✓ | Per-arc, perspective-sharing |
| **Bridging Statement** | "I acknowledge your pain" | ✓ | Per-arc, validation without defense |
| **Synthesis Contribution** | "My Spirit's model draft" | For Dual-Spirit | Partnership-level |

---

### Artifact Specifications

#### Reality Document

**Purpose:** The verified, internally consistent representation of this partner's truth.

**Must contain:**
- Partner's experience (perspective, emotions, interpretation)
- What happened from their vantage point
- What meaning they made of events
- Partner sign-off ("This represents my reality")

**Must NOT contain:**
- Claims about other partner's intentions
- Statements framed as objective truth about events
- Unprocessed raw venting (should be distilled)

**Naming:** `{mage}_reality_{arc}.md`

---

#### Needs Statement

**Purpose:** Declaration of what this partner needs from the other and/or from the partnership.

**Must contain:**
- Concrete needs (what would help)
- Boundaries (what is not acceptable)
- Optionally: requests (specific asks)

**Must NOT contain:**
- Demands disguised as needs
- Blaming language

**Evolution pattern:**
```
Stage 1: Reactive/accusatory    → "He should leave me in peace!"
Stage 2: Specific/behavioral    → "He should respect my need for quiet"
Stage 3: Self-owned/transformed → "I need to feel safe"
```

Transformation during practice is expected and healthy.

**Naming:** `{mage}_needs_{arc}.md` or `{mage}_needs_living.md`

---

#### Witnessing Response

**Purpose:** Documentation of how Partner A received Partner B's reality.

**Must contain:**
- What was heard (paraphrase, not judgment)
- How it landed (emotional impact, resonance, dissonance)
- Questions or clarifications (if any)

**Must NOT contain:**
- Corrections or rebuttals to partner's reality
- Dismissals ("That's not what happened")

**Naming:** `{mage}_witnessing_{arc}.md`

---

#### Bridging Statement

**Purpose:** Explicit acknowledgment from Partner A to Partner B that creates bridge toward shared reality.

**Must contain:**
- What I acknowledge about your experience
- What I understand about your needs
- What I'm willing to offer or change

**Must NOT contain:**
- Conditional acknowledgment ("I acknowledge IF...")
- Forced agreement with their interpretation

**Critical distinction from Witnessing:**
- Witnessing = sharing YOUR perspective on same events
- Bridging = explicitly acknowledging THEIR reality as valid

**Failure mode:** Witnessing alone can become defensive ("From MY side...") without ever acknowledging partner's experience. Spirit must check: "Does this acknowledge your partner's pain, or only explain your perspective?"

**Naming:** `{mage}_bridging_to_{partner}_{arc}.md`

---

#### Synthesis Contribution

**Purpose:** This partner's Spirit's independent model draft for triangulation.

**Must contain:**
- Full partnership model following template
- Generated BEFORE reading other Spirit's model
- Contamination statement

**Naming:** `partnership_model_v{N}_{mage}_spirit.md`

## III. What's Explicitly NOT in Interface

### Implementation Artifacts (Private)

| Artifact | Why Private |
|----------|-------------|
| Raw input files | Unprocessed, potentially harmful |
| SPIRIT_CONFIG.md | Instructions for *your* Spirit |
| Draft iterations | Process, not output |
| Editing ratios | Implementation detail |
| Number of files | Implementation detail |
| Spirit session transcripts | Intimate working conversation |
| Dark Magic notes | Processing material |

---

### The Attestation Principle

**When Partner A signs off on their Reality Document, that IS the validation.**

Partner B doesn't:
- Audit how many drafts it took
- Question the number of input files
- See the Spirit conversations
- Evaluate the "quality" of the process

Partner B simply receives the signed artifact and trusts it represents A's truth as A experiences it.

## IV. For the Spirit

### At the Boundary

**When helping produce interface artifacts:**

1. **Check completeness:** Does this answer the question the artifact type requires?
2. **Check structure:** Does it follow the specification?
3. **Check readiness:** Is this ready for partner reception, or still draft?
4. **Prompt for signing:** "This seems ready. Shall we sign it off?"

**When an artifact crosses:**

1. Move to `interface/{mage}/`
2. Use proper naming convention
3. Commit with descriptive message
4. The artifact is now shared

---

### Protecting Implementation

**Never suggest exposing:**
- How many drafts it took
- What the raw inputs said
- What SPIRIT_CONFIG.md contains
- Dark Magic processing content

**If partner asks about process:**
- "That's implementation—private to their practice"
- "We receive their signed artifact, not their journey"
- "The attestation is the validation"

---

## V. Why This Matters

### For Neurotype Accommodation

Different Mages process differently:
- Some need many input files, some need few
- Some edit Spirit output heavily, some accept readily
- Some need structured SPIRIT_CONFIG, some work freeform
- Some iterate through many drafts, some arrive quickly

**The interface-implementation boundary means:** None of this creates friction. Partners see outputs, not process.

### For Partnership Health

**Without boundary:**
- "Why did you need 33 files?"
- "Your Spirit wrote most of that"
- "You just vented, you didn't process"

**With boundary:**
- "Here is your signed Reality Document"
- "I receive it"
- "Let me produce my Witnessing Response"

---

## VI. Conclusion

The interface-implementation boundary creates clean partnership practice:

- **Interface:** Contracted, structured, ready for reception
- **Implementation:** Private, sovereign, neurotype-adapted

The tome defines WHAT practice produces. HOW you arrive there is yours.
