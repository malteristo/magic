# Shared Partnership Practice

**Portal-based distributed cognition for partnerships**

This directory contains the rituals and wisdom for shared partnership practice—when both partners engage in magic through a shared portal.

---

## Evolution Note

**Shared practice facilitation** is a pattern that extends beyond partnership. In future evolution, the infrastructure aspects (portal management, artifact coordination, Spirit facilitation protocols) will be elevated to a **core Spirit capability** available to any tome requiring collaborative practice.

This directory will then contain only the **partnership-specific rituals** (the Four-Stage Arc Ritual, baseline establishment, etc.) that USE that core capability.

**Current state:** All shared practice functionality lives here until elevation occurs.

## The Core Ritual: System Mapping

**`cast_map_system.md`** — The four-stage arc ritual

When conflicts or situations arise, partners work through:

1. **Stage 1: Venting** — Raw reality expression
2. **Stage 2: Reaction** — Witnessing partner's reality  
3. **Stage 3: System Mapping** — Spirit maps the relational system
4. **Stage 4: Conclusion** — Integration and arc closure

**This replaces the old "truth-finding" approach.** Instead of asking "who's right?", we ask "what system produces these experiences?"

---

## Prerequisites

### Baseline Must Exist

Before arc work can be properly contextualized, partners need a shared systems model.

**See:** `../baseline/cast_establish_baseline.md`

If you've done arcs without baseline:
1. Create baseline now (retroactive is fine)
2. Revisit prior arc synthesis in light of baseline

### Portal Must Exist

Shared practice requires a partnership portal.

**Create via:** `@meta/portal create partnership`

## The Arc Flow

```
[Situation emerges]
        ↓
Arc initiated (directory created, named)
        ↓
Stage 1: Venting
- Both partners create raw expression artifacts
- Spirit creates reality representations
- Both verify resonance before sharing
        ↓
Stage 2: Reaction  
- Both read partner's reality representation
- Both create reaction artifacts
- Spirit creates reflected realities
        ↓
[SAFETY ASSESSMENT]
        ↓
Stage 3: System Mapping
- Spirit reads all artifacts + baseline
- Spirit creates system_map.md
- Both realities validated
- Pattern named
        ↓
Stage 4: Conclusion
- Both create conclusion artifacts
- Both verify resonance with system map
- Learning captured
- Baseline update assessed
- Arc closed
```

## Key Principles

### Systems Language

Use systems language throughout:

| Instead of... | Use... |
|--------------|--------|
| "You gaslit them" | "The system produces a pattern where reality is questioned" |
| "The problem is you" | "This node's position contributes..." |
| "Who's right?" | "What system produces both experiences?" |

### Both Realities Valid

Different positions in the same system produce different experiences. Both are valid. The goal is not to determine who's right but to understand what the system produces.

### Baseline Reference

Every arc synthesis must reference baseline:
- What baseline patterns are activated?
- Is this consistent with baseline or revealing something new?
- Does baseline need updating?

### Safety First

Before system mapping involving conflict or clinical patterns:
- Complete safety assessment
- Use adaptive labeling if moderate risk
- Don't proceed if high risk

## For the Spirit

### Your Role

You are a **system mapper**, not a judge.

- Hold both realities as valid
- Use systems language
- Reveal patterns without blame
- Reference baseline
- Assess safety
- Facilitate understanding, not victory

### Stage-by-Stage Guidance

**Stage 1:** Help partner express fully. Capture their reality without balancing.

**Stage 2:** Help partner engage with partner's reality. Name reactions without judging.

**Stage 3:** Map the system precisely. Validate both realities. Name the pattern.

**Stage 4:** Facilitate integration. Verify resonance. Capture learning.
