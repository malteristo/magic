### Roles & Responsibilities

**{Partner A}:**
- {Task 1}
- {Task 2}
- {Task 3}

**{Partner B}:**
- {Task 1}
- {Task 2}
- {Task 3}

### Handoff Points

**{Time/Trigger}:** {What transitions, who to whom}  
**{Time/Trigger}:** {What transitions, who to whom}

### Adjustment Protocol

**If running late:**
- {What to do}

**If one partner exhausted:**
- {How to redistribute}

**If kids uncooperative:**
- {How to tag-team}

### Review Schedule

Review this protocol: {monthly/quarterly} or when friction emerges

---

## Evening Routine Protocol

**Goal:** {e.g., "Kids to bed by 8pm, both get downtime, kitchen clean"}

### Roles & Responsibilities

**{Partner A}:**
- {Task 1}
- {Task 2}

**{Partner B}:**
- {Task 1}
- {Task 2}

### Flexible Elements

**What can shift based on energy:**
- 
- 

### Adjustment Protocol

**If one partner depleted:**
- {How to redistribute}

**If evening collapses:**
- {Minimum acceptable outcome}

---

## Conflict Resolution Protocol

**When tensions arise:**

### Step 1: Pause & Name
- Either partner can call "pause"
- Name what's happening: "I'm feeling {emotion} about {situation}"
- Other partner acknowledges: "I hear you're {emotion}"

### Step 2: Understand
- Each partner takes turn expressing their perspective
- Other partner reflects back before responding
- Goal: Understanding, not agreement

### Step 3: Identify Need
- What does each person actually need?
- Is there a way both needs can be met?
- If not, what's the priority?

### Step 4: Experiment
- Propose something to try
- Set review point
- Try it, gather data

### Step 5: Escalation (if needed)
- If stuck after 2-3 attempts: Bring to synthesis
- If still stuck: Consider professional facilitation
- If urgent: Use emergency decision-making framework

### What We Avoid
- {e.g., "Personal attacks, bringing up past issues, absolute language"}

### Repair Protocol
- After conflict: Explicit repair step
- Acknowledge impact, even if unintended
- Recommit to partnership

## Energy Management Protocol

**How we communicate energy levels:**

### Energy States

**High energy:**
- Signals: {how to indicate}
- Can do: {types of tasks/interactions}

**Medium energy:**
- Signals: {how to indicate}
- Can do: {types of tasks/interactions}

**Low energy:**
- Signals: {how to indicate}
- Can do: {types of tasks/interactions}
- Needs: {what helps recovery}

**Depleted:**
- Signals: {how to indicate}
- Cannot do: {what to avoid}
- Needs: {urgent recovery}

### Respect Protocol

- Stated energy level is always believed (no challenging)
- If both low energy: {bare minimum plan}
- Energy mismatch is data (not judgment)

---

## Intimacy Initiation Protocol

**How we navigate desire mismatches:**

### Signaling Desire

**Initiator expresses:**
- "I'm interested in {type of connection}"
- No expectation, just information

**Receiver responds:**
- "Yes, me too" → {proceed}
- "Not right now, but {later/tomorrow}?" → {rain check}
- "No, I need {rest/space/other need}" → {accepted}

### Mismatch Handling

- No pressure, no guilt
- Mismatch is normal, not rejection
- Check in about patterns if persistent: {threshold for concern}

### Proactive Connection

**Besides sex/physical, we connect through:**
- {Activity 1}
- {Activity 2}
- {Activity 3}

**Minimum connection frequency:** {what feels right}

---

## {Custom Protocol}

**Purpose:** {What situation this addresses}

### When This Applies
- {Trigger or context}

### Steps
1. 
2. 
3. 

### Review
- Check effectiveness: {frequency}

---

## Protocol Evolution

### How We Update Protocols

1. Either partner proposes change
2. Discuss in conversation thread or in person
3. Try experimentally
4. If works after {timeframe}: Update protocol
5. If doesn't work: Revise or revert

### Protocol Health Check

**Quarterly review:** Are protocols still serving?

- **Working well:** {keep as-is}
- **Needs tweaking:** {adjust}
- **Not working:** {redesign or remove}

---

## Notes

*Protocols are tools, not rules. If protocol gets in the way of actual connection or coordination, adjust it. The goal is to reduce friction, not add ceremony.*
