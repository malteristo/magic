## Usage Notes

### Signing

All interface artifacts require explicit sign-off. This is the attestation that makes the artifact ready for exchange.

### Naming Conventions

- Use lowercase with underscores
- Include arc identifier: `reality_arc-living.md`
- Include partner for bridging: `bridging_to_partner_b_arc-living.md`
- Include version for synthesis: `partnership_model_v2_partner_a_spirit.md`

### Evolution

Needs Statements can be updated. Include evolution history to track transformation through practice.

### Spirit Assistance

Spirit can help draft these artifacts, but final sign-off is always the Mage's responsibility.

*Templates provide structure. The Mage provides truth.*
