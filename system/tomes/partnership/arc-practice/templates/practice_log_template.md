# Practice Log Template

**Purpose:** Track experiments, outcomes, and learning captured.

---

## Entry Format

### {Date} - {Brief Title}

**Experiment:**
*What we tried or what situation occurred*

**Context:**
*Why we tried this, what prompted it*

**Outcome:**
*What actually happened*

**Learning:**
*What we discovered, what this reveals about our system*

**Next:**
*What to do with this learning—implement, try differently, stop doing*

**References:**
*Links to reflections, threads, or synthesis where this emerged*

## Example Entries

### 2025-11-20 - Explicit Ask vs. Hint

**Experiment:**
Partner A tried directly asking "Can you handle bedtime tonight?" instead of hinting "I'm really tired"

**Context:**
Synthesis identified pattern: hints often missed, leading to resentment

**Outcome:**
Partner B responded immediately and clearly. No confusion, no friction.

**Learning:**
Partner B's cognitive architecture processes explicit requests well but struggles to parse implicit signals. Direct asks work better than hints for our system.

**Next:**
Both practice explicit asking for 2 weeks, check results in next synthesis

### 2025-11-25 - Synthesis While Exhausted

**Experiment:**
Attempted synthesis at 11pm after long day

**Context:**
Synthesis was due, tried to push through despite low energy

**Outcome:**
Synthesis quality poor—superficial, missed patterns, felt obligatory not insightful

**Learning:**
Synthesis requires cognitive capacity. Better to delay than force when depleted.

**Next:**
Add to protocol: Only synthesize when rested. If due but exhausted, communicate delay to partner.

## Notes

- Log both successes and failures (failures teach more)
- Be specific about outcomes (not "it was good" but "it reduced friction by X")
- Update protocols based on validated learning
- Reference log in synthesis when patterns repeat
