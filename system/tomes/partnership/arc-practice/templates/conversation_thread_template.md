## Notes for Thread Creators

**Good thread topics:**
- Coordination challenges (morning routine confusion, evening handoffs)
- Relationship dynamics (feeling disconnected, intimacy mismatches)
- Decision-making (should we do X? How to approach Y?)
- Pattern recognition (I keep noticing Z, want to understand)
- Needs exploration (I need something but can't articulate what)

**Thread etiquette:**
- Be specific about what you're exploring
- Assume good intent
- Ask questions rather than make accusations
- Take time to respond thoughtfully (no pressure for instant replies)
- Okay to say "I need to think about this" and return later

**When to close a thread:**
- Reached clear resolution or understanding
- Topic no longer relevant
- Thread evolved into protocol or architecture update
- Conversation better had in person
