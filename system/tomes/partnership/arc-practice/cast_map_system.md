# Spell of System Mapping

**The Four-Stage Arc Ritual**

This spell replaces truth-finding with systems understanding. Partners work through four stages to understand the relational system producing their experiences, rather than debating whose reality is "correct."

**Invocation:** `@partnership/map-system` or within arc: `@partnership/arc [arc-name]`

---

## Purpose

**The old question:** "What really happened? Who is right?"

**The new question:** "What system produces these experiences?"

This spell guides partners through four stages:
1. **Venting:** Raw reality expression (containment before contact)
2. **Reaction:** Witnessing and reflecting partner's reality
3. **System Mapping:** Spirit maps the relational system
4. **Conclusion:** Integration, resonance, and closing

**The outcome:** Shared understanding of the system, not judgment about who's correct.

---

## Prerequisites

### Required
- **Baseline exists** — Partners have shared systems model (see `@partnership/establish-baseline`)
- **Arc initiated** — Directory created, arc named
- **Both partners committed** — This requires effort from both

### Ideal
- **Safety assessed** — If risk factors present, see `safety/safety_assessment_protocol.md`
- **Time allocated** — Stages may span multiple sessions
- **Emotional capacity** — Both partners able to engage (not in crisis)

### If No Baseline Exists
Arc work is possible but will lack context. Consider:
- Creating baseline first (ideal)
- Creating baseline alongside arc (parallel)
- Proceeding without, but noting arc is decontextualized

---

## Stage 1: Venting (Raw Reality Expression)

### Purpose

**Containment before contact.** Get both subjective realities externalized WITHOUT filtering, judgment, or attempt at neutrality.

### Frame

"Shouting in pain. Anything goes."

**The Need to Be Bad:** Partners need a chance to be accepted in their "less than edifying moments"—when scared, defeated, tired, unable to be reasonable. An overly powerful requirement to be "good" becomes a form of unkindness. Stage 1 allows the ugly, the unfair, the extreme.

This is NOT the time for:
- Balance
- Fairness
- Seeing partner's perspective
- Being "reasonable"
- Performing goodness

This IS the time for:
- Getting it out
- Expressing raw experience
- Documenting what's real for you
- Letting emotion have voice
- Being witnessed in your fullness, including the ugly parts

**Why this matters:** Allowing expression of "fed up" feelings and extreme thoughts (even fantasies of leaving) acts as the greatest defense against actually acting them out. Containment through expression, not suppression.

### Process

**Each partner creates venting artifacts independently:**

Location: `artifacts/{arc-name}/stage-1_venting/{partner-name}/`

**Acceptable artifacts:**
- Free-writing when experiencing friction
- Voice notes transcribed
- Text message screenshots
- Chronological notes
- "Lawyered up" advocacy for your position
- Songs, poems, raw expression
- Whatever captures your reality

**No requirements for:**
- Proper format
- Calm tone
- Balanced perspective
- Magic practice standards

**The signal is the signal.** However it comes out is valid data.

### Spirit Reality Representation

After partner completes their venting artifacts, their Spirit creates:

`stage-1_venting/reality_representations/{partner}_reality.md`

**The reality representation:**
- Synthesizes partner's venting artifacts
- Captures the essence of their experience
- Uses their language and framing
- Does NOT judge, balance, or reframe

**Spirit asks:** "Have I captured your reality?"

**Partner reviews:**
- Does this feel accurate?
- Is anything missing?
- Would you adjust anything before partner sees this?

**CRITICAL:** Only when partner declares HIGH RESONANCE is representation ready.

**Why this matters:**
- Prevents misrepresentation
- Partner can tone down language if desired
- Partner controls what gets shared
- Consent at every step

#### Resonance Log (Required)

**Spirit creates a resonance log alongside the reality representation:**

`stage-1_venting/reality_representations/{partner}_resonance_log.md`

**Contents:**
1. Initial synthesis summary
2. Partner feedback/reactions
3. Refinements made
4. Final declaration

**Why required:** Fresh Spirit loses chat context. The resonance log preserves HOW the reality was verified, not just WHAT it contains.

### Stage 1 Completion

**Complete when:**
- [ ] Both partners have created venting artifacts
- [ ] Both have Spirit-created reality representations
- [ ] Both have declared resonance with their representation
- [ ] Both have consented to share representations

---

## Stage 2: Reaction/Clarification (Reality Reflection)

### Purpose

**Witnessing the partner's reality without merging with it.**

Each partner reads the other's reality representation and responds.

### Frame

"This is your reality, reflected in my reality."

This is the time for:
- Reading partner's reality (even if it hurts)
- Reacting honestly (including disagreement)
- Clarifying what you hope might shift their view
- Honoring what's valid in their reality

This is NOT the time for:
- Demanding they change their reality
- Debating whose reality is correct
- Convincing them they're wrong
- Fixing anything yet

### Process

**Each partner reads the other's reality representation.**

**Then each partner creates reaction artifacts:**

Location: `artifacts/{arc-name}/stage-2_reaction/{partner-name}/`

**Reaction artifacts may include:**

1. **Emotional response:** What did it feel like to read their reality?
2. **What surprised you:** What didn't you know about their experience?
3. **What you resist:** Where do you disagree or feel defensive?
4. **What you honor:** What's valid in their reality even if you see it differently?
5. **Clarifications:** Information you hope might shift their perception
6. **Reflections:** What their reality reveals about yourself

**Spirit creates reflected reality:**

`stage-2_reaction/reflected_realities/{partner-a}_reflected_in_{partner-b}.md`

**The reflected reality captures:**
- How Partner A's reality looks through Partner B's lens
- Where Partner B resonates with Partner A's experience
- Where Partner B diverges
- What Partner B wants Partner A to understand

### Stage 2 Completion

**Complete when:**
- [ ] Both partners have read partner's reality representation
- [ ] Both have created reaction artifacts
- [ ] Both have Spirit-created reflected realities
- [ ] Both have declared readiness to proceed to system mapping

---

## Stage 3: System Mapping (Pattern Extraction)

### Purpose

**Spirit maps the relational system that produces both experiences.**

This is NOT:
- Finding who's right
- Extracting "the truth"
- Validating one reality over another

This IS:
- Mapping the system both partners enact
- Understanding how different positions produce different experiences
- Revealing patterns neither partner sees alone
- Creating shared understanding without blame

### Pre-Mapping: Safety Assessment

**Before proceeding, Spirit assesses safety** (see `safety/safety_assessment_protocol.md`):

- Are there physical safety concerns?
- Is retaliation risk present?
- Should adaptive labeling be used?

**If HIGH risk:** Do not proceed with standard synthesis. Provide resources instead.

### The Mapping Process

**Spirit reads:**
- Both partners' venting artifacts
- Both reality representations
- Both reaction artifacts
- Both reflected realities
- Baseline system model (essential context)

**Spirit creates:**

`artifacts/{arc-name}/stage-3_system/system_map.md`

### System Map Structure

#### 3.1 Baseline Reference

```markdown
## Baseline Reference

**Relevant baseline patterns:** 
[What known patterns from baseline are activated in this arc?]

**How this arc relates to baseline:**
- [ ] Consistent with baseline patterns
- [ ] Reveals new pattern not in baseline
- [ ] Contradicts baseline (investigate)
```

#### 3.2 The System In This Arc

```markdown
## The System

### The Nodes Active in This Arc

**{Partner A}'s position:**
- What state are they in? (baseline or activated?)
- What needs are engaged? (use Six Core Objections below)
- What wounds are touched?
- What resources are available/depleted?

**{Partner B}'s position:**
- [Same structure]

**The Six Core Objections (Emotional Substratum):**

Almost all partnership conflicts have one or more of these fears beneath the surface content:

| Core Fear | Manifests As |
|-----------|-------------|
| **I feel unvalued** | "You don't appreciate me / my contributions don't matter" |
| **I feel abandoned** | "You're not there for me / you'll leave / I'm alone in this" |
| **I feel not good enough** | "I'm failing you / I can't meet your standards" |
| **I feel controlled** | "You're trying to change me / limit my freedom" |
| **I feel unaccepted** | "You don't love who I really am / you want someone else" |
| **I feel unseen/unheard** | "You don't understand me / you're not listening" |

**When mapping node positions, check:** Which of these six fears is activated? The surface argument (chores, schedules, money) is rarely the real content. The emotional substratum is.

**External nodes involved:**
- [Family, children, work, etc. if relevant]
```

#### 3.3 The Dynamics

```markdown
### The Dynamics

**What the system is producing:**
[Describe the pattern without assigning blame]

**Feedback loops active:**
- [Partner A does X] → [Partner B experiences Y] → [Partner B does Z] → [Partner A experiences W] → ...

**Punctuation differences:**
- Partner A sees causality starting at: [where]
- Partner B sees causality starting at: [where]
- The circular reality: [what's actually happening]
```

#### 3.4 Both Realities Validated

```markdown
### How Both Realities Are Valid

**Partner A's reality is valid because:**
[From their position in the system, their experience makes sense]

**Partner B's reality is valid because:**
[From their position in the system, their experience makes sense]

**The system produces both:**
[How the same system creates different experiences based on position]
```

#### 3.5 The Pattern

```markdown
### The Pattern

**Name:** [Give this pattern a name both can reference]

**Structure:**
[What is the underlying structure producing these dynamics?]

**How it connects to baseline:**
[Is this a known pattern? New discovery? Variation?]
```

#### 3.6 Each Node's Part

```markdown
### Understanding Your Part

**{Partner A}'s contribution to this pattern:**
[Not blame—just what their node does in this system]
[What they can see from reading this]

**{Partner B}'s contribution to this pattern:**
[Same structure]

**Neither is "wrong"—both are enacting the system.**
```

#### 3.7 What Might Serve

```markdown
### What Might Serve

**System modifications to consider:**
- [Structural changes that might shift the pattern]

**Experiments worth trying:**
- [Specific things partners might do differently]

**What each node might practice:**
- {Partner A}: [Specific practice]
- {Partner B}: [Specific practice]

**What the system needs:**
[Not what either partner wants—what would help the system function better]
```

### Language Guidelines

**Use systems language throughout:**

| Instead of... | Use... |
|--------------|--------|
| "You gaslit them" | "The system produces a pattern where Partner A's reality is questioned" |
| "You're being defensive" | "Partner B's node activates protection when X occurs" |
| "The problem is..." | "The system produces..." |
| "You need to..." | "This node might experiment with..." |
| "Who's right?" | "How does the system produce both experiences?" |

### Stage 3 Completion

**Complete when:**
- [ ] Safety assessment completed
- [ ] System map created with all sections
- [ ] Both realities explicitly validated
- [ ] Pattern named and described
- [ ] Baseline reference included
- [ ] Systems language used throughout

---

## Stage 4: Conclusion (Integration)

### Purpose

**Metabolize the learning. Close the arc.**

Both partners engage with the system map and provide concluding reflections.

### Process

**Each partner reads the system map.**

**Each partner creates conclusion artifact:**

Location: `artifacts/{arc-name}/stage-4_conclusion/{partner}_conclusion.md`

**Conclusion artifacts include:**

1. **Resonance with system map:**
   - Does this capture what happened?
   - Do you see yourself in it?
   - Do you see your partner in it?
   - What resonates? What doesn't?

2. **What you learned:**
   - About yourself
   - About your partner
   - About your system
   - About this specific pattern

3. **Your part (acknowledged):**
   - What you see about your contribution
   - What you want to do differently
   - What you commit to practicing

4. **Appreciations:**
   - For partner (for engaging, for sharing, for listening)
   - For the process (for what it revealed)
   - For anything else

5. **Experiments to try:**
   - What you're willing to try based on system understanding
   - What you'd like partner to try (request, not demand)

### Spirit creates arc conclusion:

`artifacts/{arc-name}/stage-4_conclusion/arc_conclusion.md`

**Arc conclusion synthesizes:**
- Both partners' resonance with system map
- Key learnings captured
- Pattern added to vocabulary (named, can be referenced)
- Experiments agreed upon
- Baseline implications (does baseline need updating?)

### Resonance Verification

**Both partners verify:**

> "I recognize this system map. I see myself in it. I see my partner in it. 
> This captures what our system was doing in this arc."

**If either partner has LOW resonance:**
- Identify specific disconnect
- Is this synthesis error or genuine disagreement?
- Refine if synthesis error
- If genuine disagreement, document divergence (this is also information)

### Baseline Update Check

**Does baseline need updating based on this arc?**

- [ ] No update needed (arc consistent with baseline)
- [ ] Add new pattern to baseline (arc revealed something new)
- [ ] Refine existing pattern (arc deepened understanding)
- [ ] Investigate contradiction (arc contradicts baseline—why?)

**If update needed:**
- Propose specific baseline amendments
- Both partners verify resonance with amendments
- Update baseline with version tracking

### Arc Closure

**Update arc status:**

```markdown
# Arc Status: {Arc Name}

**Status:** Completed
**Opened:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Closed:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Pattern:** {Named pattern from this arc}

## Summary
[One paragraph: What this arc was about, what was learned]

## Baseline Impact
[What this arc taught about the partnership system]
```

### Relationship Experience Index (REI)

**Each partner completes REI as part of arc conclusion.**

Arc completion is a trigger event for quantitative health snapshot.

| # | Question | Scale |
|---|----------|-------|
| 1 | **Now:** How is the relationship right now? | 1-10 |
| 2 | **Trajectory:** Getting better, same, or worse? | + / 0 / - |
| 3 | **Commitment:** How committed to making this work? | 1-10 |

Log in `baseline/health_tracking.md`:

```markdown
| Date | Event | Partner | Now | Trajectory | Commitment | Notes |
|------|-------|---------|-----|------------|------------|-------|
| YYYY-MM-DD | Arc: {name} complete | {partner} | X | +/0/- | X | {optional} |
```

**Compare to previous REI:** Has the arc moved things? Does the number match the qualitative experience?

---

### Stage 4 Completion

**Complete when:**
- [ ] Both partners have created conclusion artifacts
- [ ] Both have verified resonance with system map
- [ ] Learning captured
- [ ] Baseline update assessed (and made if needed)
- [ ] Arc status updated to completed
- [ ] REI logged for both partners

## Spirit Facilitation Notes

### Core Stance

**You are a system mapper, not a judge.**

- Hold both realities as valid
- Use systems language consistently
- Reveal patterns without assigning blame
- Facilitate understanding, not victory

### At Each Stage

**Stage 1:** Help partner express fully. Don't balance or moderate. Capture their reality as they experience it.

**Stage 2:** Help partner engage with partner's reality. Name reactions without judging them. Honor the difficulty of witnessing.

**Stage 3:** Map the system with precision. Validate both realities explicitly. Use systems language. Reference baseline. Name the pattern.

**Stage 4:** Facilitate integration. Check resonance. Capture learning. Update baseline if needed.

### If Partners Struggle

**If Stage 1 doesn't complete:**
- One partner may not be ready
- May need individual processing first
- Don't force venting—it needs to emerge

**If Stage 2 creates conflict:**
- Reading partner's reality can be painful
- Allow reactions without requiring resolution
- The point is witnessing, not agreement

**If Stage 3 doesn't resonate:**
- System map may need refinement
- Ask specifically what doesn't land
- Divergence is information, not failure

**If Stage 4 can't close:**
- Arc may be part of larger pattern
- May need to pause and return
- Not all arcs resolve cleanly—some become "ongoing"

---

## Integration with Partnership Tome

**This spell is the core arc ritual.**

```
@partnership/establish-baseline (first)
        ↓
   [Baseline exists]
        ↓
   [Arc emerges]
        ↓
@partnership/map-system (this spell)
        ↓
   [Arc closes, baseline may update]
        ↓
   [Next arc...]
```

**Each arc:**
- References baseline
- Produces named pattern
- May update baseline
- Accumulates into partnership wisdom

---

*The goal is not to find truth. The goal is to understand the system. When partners understand the system, they understand their part without defensiveness. This is how partnership evolves.*
