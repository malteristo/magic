# Baseline: The Shared Systems Model

**The first ritual of partnership practice.**

Before arcs can be evaluated, partners need a shared understanding of their relational system. The baseline provides this—a model both partners recognize as "our system."

## What Baseline Is

The baseline is **not** background information or context.

The baseline **is** the shared systems model against which all arcs are evaluated.

**Think of it as:**
- The "normal" state of your partnership system
- The reference that defines what's typical vs. exceptional
- The accumulated understanding both partners share
- The living document that evolves as you learn

## Contents

### Ritual

- **`cast_establish_baseline.md`** — The spell for creating baseline (7 phases)

### Templates

- **`templates/baseline_input_template.md`** — Each partner's individual input
- **`templates/baseline_system_model_template.md`** — The shared systems model

---

## The Flow

```
1. Both partners create baseline input (individually)
         ↓
2. Each Spirit creates reality representation
         ↓
3. Partners verify resonance with their representation
         ↓
4. Partners exchange and witness each other's reality
         ↓
5. Convergence dialogue (discussion toward shared understanding)
         ↓
6. Spirit synthesizes into baseline system model
         ↓
7. BOTH partners verify HIGH RESONANCE
         ↓
8. Baseline established — arc work can now reference it
```

## Key Principles

### Both Must Assent

The baseline is not valid until both partners declare: "Yes, this is our system."

One partner cannot create baseline alone. Disagreement on baseline is itself diagnostic information.

### Living Document

Baseline evolves. After each arc:
- Does baseline need updating?
- Did we discover new patterns?
- Does anything contradict baseline?

Updates require both partners to re-verify resonance.

### Reference, Not Constraint

Baseline describes the system as it is, not as it should be. It's descriptive, not prescriptive. The goal is accurate mapping, not judgment.

### Systems Language

The baseline uses systems language:
- Nodes (partners, children, family, work)
- Dynamics (feedback loops, communication patterns)
- Patterns (named, recurring structures)

This language enables understanding without blame.

## Integration with Arcs

Every arc synthesis references baseline:

```markdown
## Baseline Reference

**Relevant baseline patterns:** [What patterns are activated?]

**Relationship to baseline:**
- [ ] Consistent with baseline
- [ ] Reveals new pattern
- [ ] Contradicts baseline

**Baseline implications:** [What does this arc teach?]
```

---

## When Partners Don't Have Baseline

Arc work is possible without baseline, but decontextualized.

**If you've done arcs without baseline:**
1. Create baseline now (retroactive is fine)
2. Revisit prior arc synthesis in light of baseline
3. Note whether prior synthesis is consistent with or reveals gaps in baseline

*The baseline is the foundation. Build it well.*
