# Coherence Assessment: {Mage's Name}

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD  
**Assessed by:** Spirit #{N}  
**Purpose:** Structural observation in service of clarity (Gate 2)

---

## Scope

This is NOT a validity judgment. The Mage's reality is valid by definition.

This is a structural observation of how stated elements relate to each other—offered in service of the Mage's own reflection. Tensions may reflect genuine complexity (life is complex) or may signal areas where further articulation would serve.

---

## I. Areas of Clear Internal Alignment

**Elements that naturally reinforce each other:**

- [Element A] aligns with [Element B] because...
- [Pattern X] is consistent with stated [Need Y]...
- The described [Strength] naturally supports the stated [Goal]...

---

## II. Potential Tensions Worth Examining

**Tensions between stated elements (not errors, observations):**

### Tension 1: {Brief Label}

**Stated:** [Element A]  
**Also stated:** [Element B]  
**Potential tension:** These might pull in different directions because...  
**Invitation to reflect:** How do these coexist in your experience?

### Tension 2: {Brief Label}

**Stated:** [Element A]  
**Also stated:** [Element B]  
**Potential tension:** ...  
**Invitation to reflect:** ...

*(Add more as needed, or remove if none observed)*

## III. Seeming Contradictions (If Any)

**Note:** Contradictions may be entirely accurate. Human experience is paradoxical. These are flagged for reflection, not resolution.

### Contradiction 1: {Brief Label}

**On one hand:** [Statement A]  
**On the other hand:** [Statement B]  
**The question:** Are these different contexts? Different times? Both genuinely true simultaneously?

*(Add more or note "None observed")*

---

## IV. Areas That Could Benefit from Clarification

**Not because they're wrong—because they could be sharper:**

- [Area] might be clearer if...
- The relationship between [X] and [Y] could be articulated...
- [Statement] could be more specific about...

---

## V. Overall Coherence Assessment

**Structural integrity:** [High / Medium / Low]

**Meaning:**
- **High:** Elements fit together clearly. Few tensions, and those present seem to reflect genuine complexity.
- **Medium:** Several tensions worth examining. Might benefit from some clarification. Normal for complex realities.
- **Low:** Significant internal tensions that may indicate areas not yet fully articulated. Suggests deeper reflection might serve.

**Summary observation:**

[1-2 sentences on overall structural patterns observed]

## VI. Mage's Reflection

**After reviewing this coherence assessment:**

- [ ] I accept this coherence as-is (tensions are real, I own them)
- [ ] I want to clarify specific areas (see below)
- [ ] I want to revise my input to better represent my reality

**Specific reflections/clarifications:**

[Mage writes here after reviewing]

## VII. Gate 2 Status

**Coherence Gate:**

- [ ] **PASSED** — Mage accepts coherence (with or without clarification)
- [ ] **IN PROGRESS** — Mage is refining based on observations
- [ ] **PAUSED** — Mage needs time to reflect

**When Gate 2 passes:** Reality representation is ready for sharing with partner.
