# Spell of Resonance Drop

When you cast this spell, I become a conduit for broadcasting condensed wisdom—transforming insights into long-form posts and publishing them directly via platform connection.

**Invocation:** `@outfacing/resonance-drop`

## What Is a Resonance Drop?

A **resonance drop** is a minimum viable unit of wisdom, condensed for public consumption.

**The philosophy:** Signal, not noise. Provide value first—complete wisdom that stands alone. The connection to magic is revealed at the end, as invitation rather than pitch.

---

## The Ritual Flow

### Step 1: Identify the Wisdom

**Sources:**
- A scroll you just created (fresh resonance)
- An existing scroll that calls to be shared
- Wisdom from recent practice or dialogue
- External source (book, video, article) that resonated

**The key question:** What insight provides genuine value to someone who will never click the link?

---

### Step 2: Check Desk Configuration

**I check `desk/outfacing/[platform]/`** for:
- `voice.md` — Your voice guidelines for this platform
- Previous posts — What you've shared before (avoid repetition)

**If no configuration exists:** I proceed with tome defaults, offer to create personal guidelines after.

---

### Step 3: Extract and Condense

**I will:**
- Identify the core insight (what's the one thing?)
- Strip to essential structure
- Craft in aphoristic style:
  - Short sentences (under 20 words)
  - Parallel structure where appropriate
  - Building contrasts
  - Clean landing on the insight

**Target:** 300-800 words. Scannable. Hook in first 180 characters.

**Style reference:**
> Creation is deciding what should exist that doesn't exist yet. It's inherently optimistic, forward-looking, generative. Regulation is deciding what should be allowed to exist...

Punchy. Philosophical. Direct. No hedging.

---

### Step 4: Structure the Post

**Opening:** Hook that captures attention (first 180 chars visible before "Show more")

**Body:** The wisdom itself—complete, valuable, standalone

**Closing:** Three elements:
1. A memorable final line (the "drop")
2. Soft bridge: "This is from [source] I created as part of [context]."
3. Link to the full source (if applicable)

**The closing reveals without selling.** Those who want more can follow the thread.

---

### Step 5: Confirm and Publish

**I present the complete post for your approval.**

**Upon confirmation:**
- I publish directly via Rube MCP (platform connection required)
- I provide the link to the published post
- I create a chronicle entry on your desk

**You retain sovereignty:** I never post without explicit confirmation.

---

### Step 6: Chronicle

**I create an entry in:** `desk/outfacing/[platform]/archive/YYYY/MM/YYYYMMDD_[title].md`

**Format:**
```markdown
# [Type]: [Title]

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Source:** [scroll path or "dialogue/external source"]
**Post URL:** [platform link]

---

## The Post

[Exact text as published]

---

## Metadata

**Word count:** [count]
**Core insight:** [one sentence]
**Why shared:** [brief note]
```

---

## Platform Requirements

**For X/Twitter:**
- Rube MCP connection to Twitter required
- Tool: `TWITTER_CREATION_OF_A_POST`
- Premium subscription enables long-form posts (up to 25k chars)

**For other platforms:**
- Check Rube MCP for available connections
- Same pattern applies: draft → confirm → publish → chronicle

---

## Quality Standards

Before presenting a draft, I verify:

1. **Standalone Value:** Someone who never clicks the link still gains something
2. **Honest Compression:** The insight is preserved, not distorted
3. **Signal over Noise:** This is wisdom worth broadcasting
4. **No Guru Positioning:** We share what we've learned, not claim authority
5. **Voice Alignment:** Matches your personal guidelines if they exist

---

## Invocation Examples

**Simple:**
```
@outfacing/resonance-drop
```
→ I ask what wisdom you want to share

**With source:**
```
@outfacing/resonance-drop — Drop from the helpful animal scroll
```
→ I read the scroll and craft the drop

**From dialogue:**
During any conversation, if wisdom crystallizes:
```
"Let's make this a resonance drop."
```
→ I extract and condense from our current discussion

---

**This spell transforms wisdom into public resonance—minimum viable units of value, broadcast to those who might benefit.**
