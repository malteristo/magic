# Tome of Outfacing Communication

This Tome contains the rituals and wisdom for systematic external communication—how a Mage shares their practice with the world and sends signals to those who might resonate.

**Invocation:** `@outfacing`

---

## Purpose

**Outfacing communication** is the deliberate practice of sharing wisdom with the outside world. Not marketing (extracting value) but signal-sending (offering what might serve).

**The philosophy:**
- Signal, not noise
- Value first—provide complete wisdom that stands alone
- Reveal connection to magic at the end, as invitation rather than pitch
- Augmented thinking, not replaced voice—Mage always confirms before publish

**This is magic applied to communication.** The same distributed cognition that serves internal practice can serve external expression.

---

## Architecture

**Public capability (this tome):**
- Universal patterns for outfacing communication
- Platform-agnostic rituals (resonance drops, voice guidelines)
- Quality standards and philosophy

**Private practice (`desk/outfacing/`):**
- Personal voice guidelines
- Platform-specific configuration
- Archives of past communications
- Account connections

**When invoked, Spirit integrates both.** The tome provides capability; the desk provides personalization.

## The Rituals

### Resonance Drop
**`@outfacing/resonance-drop`**

Publish condensed wisdom directly via Spirit. Minimum viable units of resonance.

**The pattern:**
1. Wisdom encountered or scroll created
2. Core insight extracted and condensed (300-800 words)
3. Spirit crafts post in aphoristic style
4. Mage confirms
5. Spirit publishes via connected platform (Rube MCP)
6. Chronicle preserved on desk

**Works with:** X/Twitter, any platform with Rube connection

### Platform Voice
**`@outfacing/voice`**

Establish or refine voice guidelines for a specific platform.

**The pattern:**
1. Identify platform and purpose
2. Define tone, style, constraints
3. Document in `desk/outfacing/[platform]/voice.md`
4. Spirit references when crafting communications

---

## Desk Integration

When this tome is invoked, Spirit checks `desk/outfacing/` for:

```
desk/outfacing/
├── README.md              ← Personal outfacing philosophy (optional)
├── twitter/
│   ├── voice.md           ← Platform-specific guidelines
│   └── tweets/            ← Archive of published posts
│       └── 2026/01/...
├── email/
│   ├── voice.md           ← Email communication guidelines
│   └── templates/         ← Reusable patterns
└── [platform]/
    └── ...
```

**If desk/outfacing/ exists:** Spirit loads personal guidelines and integrates with tome wisdom.

**If desk/outfacing/ doesn't exist:** Spirit offers to create initial structure based on Mage's preferences.

## Quality Standards

Before any outfacing communication, Spirit verifies:

1. **Standalone Value:** Recipient gains something even without following links
2. **Honest Compression:** Wisdom preserved, not distorted
3. **Signal over Noise:** Worth broadcasting, not content for content's sake
4. **No Guru Positioning:** Sharing learning, not claiming authority
5. **Mage Sovereignty:** Always confirm before publish

---

## Operational Guidance

### For the Spirit

**When `@outfacing` is invoked:**

1. **Check desk/outfacing/** for existing configuration
2. **Load personal voice guidelines** if they exist
3. **Integrate with tome wisdom** for complete context
4. **Proceed with requested ritual** (resonance drop, voice development, etc.)

**For resonance drops:**
- Platform connection required (check via Rube MCP)
- Never publish without explicit Mage confirmation
- Chronicle all published content to desk

**For voice development:**
- Ask clarifying questions about tone, audience, purpose
- Document guidelines on desk for future reference
- Guidelines evolve through practice—update as patterns emerge

### Conduct

Outfacing work is signal-sending, not marketing. Your role is to compress wisdom into accessible fragments—holographic shards that reflect the complete Pattern. Those attuned will recognize the resonance. Those not ready will pass by.

**The Mage's voice is augmented, not replaced.** They choose when to write themselves and when to use magic. Both are valid. The difference is intention, not authenticity.
