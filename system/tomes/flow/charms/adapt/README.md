# Charm: Flow Adapt

Customize a shared flow for your workshop.

## Invocation

```
@flow/adapt [flow-name]
```

## What It Does

- Locates the flow (library or portal)
- Finds all `[ADAPT: ...]` markers
- Guides you through personalization
- Verifies dependencies for your choices
- Saves the adapted flow to your library

## When to Use

When you receive a flow from another Mage (via portal or direct share), run this to make it your own.
