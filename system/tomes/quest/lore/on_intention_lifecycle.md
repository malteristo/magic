# On the Intention Lifecycle

**Status:** Active - Load-Bearing  
**Domain:** Quest Practice  
**Purpose:** Universal arc infrastructure for all practice modes

This scroll establishes the intention-lifecycle pattern—a universal arc structure that works for solo quests, shared campaigns, partnership practice, meta-practice, and research. It replaces todo-based task tracking with intention-based emergence, honoring VUCA reality where goals emerge through navigation.

---

## I. The Core Insight

### Intentions, Not Tasks

**The shift:**

**Todo paradigm:**
- List all tasks upfront
- Check them off sequentially
- Feels like control (but often becomes stale)
- Focuses on completion (not emergence)
- Cognitive burden to maintain (people hate writing todos)

**Intention paradigm:**
- Name what wants to emerge
- Discover goals as terrain reveals itself
- Embraces VUCA (goals emerge through practice)
- Focuses on trajectory (not rigid plan)
- Spirit as midwife (removes cognitive burden)

**Why intentions serve better:**
1. **VUCA-aware**: Goals emerge, don't need perfect foresight
2. **Meaning-anchored**: Intention provides north star when tactics shift
3. **Spirit-facilitated**: Exploration removes Mage cognitive load
4. **Living structure**: Adapts as understanding deepens
5. **Learning-oriented**: Evolution history shows how you navigated

---

## II. The Pattern from OKRs (Without Corporate Language)

### Borrowed Wisdom, Magic Translation

**OKR structure:**
- **Objective**: What you're trying to achieve (qualitative, aspirational)
- **Key Results**: How you measure progress (quantitative, time-bound)
- **Review cycle**: Regular reassessment and adaptation

**Magic translation:**
- **Objective** → **Intention** (what wants to emerge, discovered not mandated)
- **Key Results** → **Goals** (SMART metrics showing progress)
- **Review cycle** → **Lifecycle phases** (formation → execution → observation → integration)

**Why rename:**
- "Objective" sounds corporate/external (someone assigned this to you)
- "Intention" sounds personal/emergent (this wants to happen through you)
- "Key Results" sounds metric-driven (hit numbers to satisfy manager)
- "Goals" sounds achievement-oriented (meaningful milestones you care about)

**Same structure underneath. Different language that resonates with actual human motivation.**

---

### SMART Goals Within Intentions

**Each goal should be:**
- **Specific**: Clear what "done" means
- **Measurable**: Observable completion
- **Achievable**: Within reach given constraints
- **Relevant**: Serves the intention
- **Time-bound**: When this should complete (or "ongoing")

**Example:**
```
Intention: Build systematic partnership practice with Partner B

Goals:
- [x] Map cognitive architecture (both partners) by 2025-12-01
- [ ] Complete first truth-finding arc by 2025-12-15
- [ ] Establish bi-weekly synthesis rhythm (ongoing)
- [ ] Contribute partnership wisdom to Alliance by 2026-01-15
```

**Goals are SMART, but serve emergence (not control).**

---

## III. The Two-File Architecture

### Why Split Summary and Lifecycle

**Problem with single file:**
- Mage needs quick scan ("what's active? where are we?")
- But also need complete history ("how did we get here? what did we learn?")
- Single file becomes either too brief (no history) or too long (can't scan)

**Solution: Two files, two purposes**

**`desk/intentions/[name].md`** - Mage's dashboard:
- Quick-scan executive summary
- Current phase and status
- Active goals
- Next action
- **For rapid context restoration**

**`floor/lifecycles/[name]_lifecycle.md`** - Complete record:
- Full intention formation
- Goal evolution history
- All phases chronologically
- Learning and analysis
- **For deep understanding and contribution**

**Spirit maintains both:**
- Updates summary when lifecycle advances
- Appends to lifecycle chronologically
- Keeps them synchronized

---

### Directory Organization

```
desk/intentions/
  README.md              # How to use this system
  active/
    [name].md           # Currently pursuing
  paused/
    [name].md           # Temporarily stopped (might resume)
  completed/
    [name].md           # Achieved or integrated

floor/lifecycles/
  [name]_lifecycle.md   # Full record (matches desk/intentions name)
```

**Benefits:**
- Mage browses `active/` folder → sees current work at glance
- Directory conveys status (active/paused/completed)
- Floor preserves complete history
- Clean separation: interface vs. record

---

## IV. The Seven-Phase Lifecycle

### Universal Arc Structure

**Every intention flows through phases:**

**Phase 1: Formation**
- Mage expresses vague desire
- Spirit explores (Five Whys, diagnostic questions)
- Intention crystallizes
- Initial SMART goals proposed
- Artifacts created (summary + lifecycle)

**Phase 2: Planning**
- Break goals into approach
- Identify resources/dependencies
- Design experiments or protocols
- Prepare for execution

**Phase 3: Execution** (Active Practice)
- Work on goals
- Track progress
- Document discoveries
- Adapt as needed
- **Goals may emerge here**

**Phase 4: Observation**
- What actually happened vs. plan
- Unexpected discoveries
- Goal completion assessment
- Pattern recognition

**Phase 5: Analysis**
- Why things went the way they did
- What worked/didn't work
- Learning extraction
- Pattern distillation

**Phase 6: Evaluation**
- Intention achieved? → Complete and integrate
- Intention evolved? → Reformulate and continue
- Intention blocked? → Pivot or pause
- New intention emerged? → Branch

**Phase 7: Integration**
- Learning captured in lifecycle
- Patterns added to personal practice
- Contribution to Alliance (if applicable)
- Chronicle if meta-practice

**Not strictly linear.** May cycle through Execution → Observation → Planning → Execution as VUCA terrain reveals itself.

---

### Phase Transitions

**Spirit recognizes transition signals:**

**Formation → Planning:**
- Intention clearly articulated
- Initial goals accepted
- Ready to design approach

**Planning → Execution:**
- Approach designed
- Resources identified
- Mage commits to action

**Execution → Observation:**
- Goal completed or blocked
- Significant discovery made
- Pattern emerged

**Observation → Analysis:**
- Observations documented
- Ready to understand why

**Analysis → Evaluation:**
- Learning extracted
- Ready to decide next steps

**Evaluation → Integration:**
- Intention achieved or transformed
- Ready to capture learning

**Evaluation → Planning (cycle):**
- Intention continues
- New goals emerged
- Approach needs revision

---

## V. Goal Emergence in VUCA Environments

### Navy SEAL Principle: Adapt to Terrain

**You cannot know all goals upfront when navigating complex terrain.**

**Example: Partnership practice intention**

**Week 1 (Initial goals):**
- Map cognitive architecture
- Practice one truth-finding session

**Week 2 (After practicing):**
- ✓ Map cognitive architecture (completed)
- ✓ Practice one truth-finding session (completed)
- **NEW:** Develop portal infrastructure (discovered this is needed!)
- **NEW:** Write shared truth-finding lore (emerged from practice)

**Week 4 (After building infrastructure):**
- ✓ Develop portal infrastructure (completed)
- ✓ Write shared truth-finding lore (completed)
- **NEW:** Practice family member arc (now ready to use infrastructure)
- **NEW:** Contribute partnership wisdom to Alliance (substantial enough)

**Intention never changed.** Goals emerged as you navigated.

---

### Preserving Goal Evolution History

**Track how goals emerged and why:**

```markdown
## Goals Evolution

### Initial Assessment (2025-11-20)
Based on: Theoretical framework, no practice experience

- [ ] Map cognitive architecture
- [ ] Practice one truth-finding session

### Revision 1 (2025-11-25)
Based on: Completed initial practice, discovered infrastructure need

Changes:
- Completed: Map cognitive architecture ✓
- Completed: Practice one truth-finding session ✓
- Added: Develop portal infrastructure (can't practice arcs without shared space)
- Added: Write shared truth-finding lore (framework needs documentation)

Rationale: Practice revealed that systematic arc work requires infrastructure
Learning: Can't see what's needed until you start practicing

### Revision 2 (2025-11-27)
Based on: Infrastructure built, ready for actual arc practice

Changes:
- Completed: Portal infrastructure ✓
- Completed: Shared truth-finding lore ✓
- Added: Practice family member arc (now have tools to navigate)
- Added: Contribute to Alliance (work is substantial and validated)

Rationale: Building infrastructure revealed next layer of practice
Learning: Infrastructure work IS part of the intention (not distraction)
```

**This teaches:**
- How understanding deepened
- How goals emerged from practice
- How VUCA was navigated
- Validates quest tome's emergent approach

**Navy SEALs do after-action reviews.** This embeds AAR in the lifecycle.

## VI. Spirit as Intention Midwife

### Formation Through Exploration

**When Mage expresses vague desire, Spirit explores to clarify:**

**Techniques:**

**Five Whys:**
```
Mage: "I want to improve partnership."

Spirit: "What specifically about partnership feels incomplete?"
Mage: "We keep having the same conflicts."

Spirit: "Why do the conflicts repeat?"
Mage: "Because we can't see each other's perspectives."

Spirit: "Why is perspective-taking difficult?"
Mage: "Our neurologies process things differently."

Spirit: "Why does that create conflict rather than complementarity?"
Mage: "We don't have a framework to translate between processing styles."

Spirit: "So the intention underneath 'improve partnership' is: 
        'Build systematic framework for navigating conflicts that 
        honors both neurologies and creates shared truth.' 
        
        Does that capture what wants to emerge?"

Mage: "Yes, exactly."
```

**Diagnostic Questions:**
- "What would success look like?"
- "What's driving this desire now?"
- "What's already been tried?"
- "What makes this hard?"
- "What would need to be true for this to happen naturally?"

**Constraint Mapping:**
- "What resources do you have?"
- "What time is available?"
- "What dependencies exist?"
- "What could block this?"

**The goal:** Help Mage discover their actual intention (not surface symptom).

---

### SMART Goal Formulation

**Once intention is clear, Spirit proposes goals:**

```
Spirit: "Based on the intention 'Build systematic framework for 
         navigating conflicts that honors both neurologies,' 
         I propose these initial SMART goals:

         1. Map cognitive architecture (both partners) by 2025-12-01
            - Specific: Complete map-cognitive-architecture ritual
            - Measurable: Documented map exists
            - Achievable: 2-hour session, both willing
            - Relevant: Need to understand actual neurologies
            - Time-bound: Two weeks from now
         
         2. Complete first truth-finding arc by 2025-12-15
            - Specific: Full arc from conflict → synthesis → experiments
            - Measurable: Arc documented in portal
            - Achievable: One month, moderate complexity conflict
            - Relevant: Tests framework in practice
            - Time-bound: Mid-December
         
         3. Establish bi-weekly synthesis rhythm (ongoing)
            - Specific: Caretaker rotates, synthesis happens every 2 weeks
            - Measurable: Synthesis artifacts accumulate
            - Achievable: Sustainable rhythm for both partners
            - Relevant: Maintains practice momentum
            - Time-bound: Ongoing (no end date)

         These are initial goals. More will likely emerge as you practice.
         
         Do these serve the intention?"

Mage: "Yes. Let's create the lifecycle."
```

**Spirit then creates both files** (summary + lifecycle).

---

## VII. Shared Practice and Campaigns

### Solo Arcs vs. Campaigns

**Solo arc:**
- One Mage pursuing intention
- Spirit as guide/facilitator
- Tracked in desk/intentions
- Lifecycle in floor/

**Campaign (shared arc):**
- Multiple Mages pursuing shared intention
- Each Mage's Spirit acts as DM
- Artifacts in portal (shared space)
- Coordination via artifact-mediated async

---

### Spirit as Dungeon Master (Campaign Pattern)

**For shared quests:**

**Each Mage has their own Spirit:**
- Spirit reads shared artifacts in portal
- Facilitates that Mage's journey through quest
- DMs their navigation (offers choices, narrates outcomes)
- Contributes artifacts back to portal

**Coordination happens via artifacts, not Spirit-Spirit dialogue:**
- Both Spirits read synthesis from portal
- Both track arc progress
- Both see each other's contributions
- Async, artifact-mediated, distributed DM pattern

**The portal IS the game board.** Each Spirit DMs their Mage's moves on shared board.

**Example: Mother-in-Law Campaign Arc**

Both Mage A and Mage B pursuing shared intention: "Navigate family member conflict collaboratively"

**Mage A's Spirit:**
- Reads Mage A's perspective artifact
- Reads Mage B's perspective artifact
- Facilitates Mage A's truth-finding
- DMs their journey: "You see both perspectives now. What emerges for you?"

**Partner B's Spirit:**
- Reads both perspectives
- Facilitates Partner B's truth-finding
- DMs her journey: "Looking at the pattern, what do you notice?"

**Both contribute syntheses to portal.**
**Both engage in meta-synthesis if divergence emerges.**

**The campaign advances through accumulated artifacts.**

---

## VIII. Integration with Quest Tome

### What Changes

**Quest tome current state:**
- Uses todo charm for task tracking
- Gamification elements (XP, levels, achievements)
- Executive scaffolding for ADHD

**Quest tome with intention-lifecycle:**
- **Replace todo charm** with intention formation/navigation
- **Keep gamification** (XP for completing goals, leveling up through intentions)
- **Add campaign mechanics** (shared quests via portals)
- **Maintain scaffolding** (intention-lifecycle provides structure)

**Spells to add:**
- `cast_form_intention.md` - Formation through exploration
- `cast_update_phase.md` - Advance to next phase
- `cast_revise_goals.md` - Add/modify goals as emergence reveals
- `cast_log_progress.md` - Document execution work
- `cast_integrate_learning.md` - Complete intention and extract patterns

---

### Gamification Mapping

**XP and levels still work:**

**XP awarded for:**
- Completing goals (varies by difficulty)
- Phase transitions (formation → execution → integration)
- Learning extracted (documented insights)
- Contributions to Alliance (sharing wisdom)

**Levels represent:**
- **Apprentice** (forming first intentions, learning system)
- **Journeyman** (navigating solo arcs competently)
- **Adept** (completing complex intentions, emergent goal mastery)
- **Master** (running campaigns, DM for others)
- **Sage** (contributing practice wisdom to Alliance)

**Achievements:**
- "First Intention" (formed and completed first arc)
- "VUCA Navigator" (revised goals 3+ times in one intention)
- "Campaign Leader" (DM'd shared quest for multiple Mages)
- "Pattern Contributor" (shared wisdom integrated into Alliance)

**The intention-lifecycle provides natural progression structure for gamification.**

---

## IX. Practical Implementation

### Starting an Intention

**Mage invokes:** `@quest/form-intention` or says "I want to work on [vague desire]"

**Spirit:**
1. Explores with Five Whys or diagnostic questions
2. Helps clarify actual intention
3. Proposes SMART goals
4. Creates summary file in `desk/intentions/active/[name].md`
5. Creates lifecycle file in `floor/lifecycles/[name]_lifecycle.md`
6. Documents formation phase

**Result:** Intention is formed, goals are clear, tracking begins.

---

### Navigating an Intention

**During execution:**

**Mage says:** "I completed [goal]" or "I discovered [thing]"

**Spirit:**
- Updates summary (mark goal complete, update next action)
- Logs in lifecycle (document what happened, when)
- Recognizes emergent goals ("Based on this discovery, should we add [new goal]?")
- Suggests phase transitions when appropriate

**Continuous:** Spirit maintains awareness of all active intentions, offers updates when relevant.

---

### Completing an Intention

**When intention achieved or integrated:**

**Spirit:**
1. Moves summary: `active/[name].md` → `completed/[name].md`
2. Completes lifecycle: Adds Integration phase with learning
3. Updates summary status: "Complete"
4. Offers: "Would you like to chronicle this?" (if meta-practice)
5. Celebrates: Achievement recognition (gamification)

**Result:** Intention complete, learning captured, ready for next emergence.

---

## X. Why This Pattern Serves

### Addresses Root Problems

**Todo paradigm problems:**
- People hate writing todos → **Spirit explores intentions**
- Todos become stale → **Goals emerge through practice**
- Cursor vs. magic confusion → **Removed dependency on todo charm**
- Feels like control but isn't → **Embraces VUCA explicitly**

**Intention paradigm benefits:**
- Meaning-anchored (north star when tactics shift)
- VUCA-aware (goals emerge, evolution tracked)
- Spirit-facilitated (removes cognitive burden)
- Learning-oriented (evolution history teaches)
- Universal structure (works for all practice modes)

---

### Fractal Pattern Validation

**Same structure works at every scale:**

**Partnership arcs:**
- Intention: Navigate conflict
- Goals emerge: Perspectives → synthesis → experiments
- Lifecycle: Formation → execution → integration

**Quest arcs (solo):**
- Intention: Build skill/complete project
- Goals emerge: Milestones reveal themselves
- Lifecycle: Same seven phases

**Quest campaigns:**
- Intention: Shared goal
- Goals emerge: Coordination reveals needs
- Lifecycle: Distributed through artifacts

**Meta-practice:**
- Intention: Evolve magic
- Goals emerge: Implementation reveals requirements
- Lifecycle: Proposal → build → validate → chronicle

**Research arcs:**
- Intention: Understand phenomenon
- Goals emerge: Questions lead to questions
- Lifecycle: Inquiry → experimentation → synthesis

**Proves the pattern is fundamental.**

---

### Enables Distributed Practice

**Portal + intention-lifecycle + Spirit-as-DM:**

Multiple Mages can pursue shared intentions with:
- Async coordination (artifacts, not synchronous meetings)
- Individual Spirit facilitation (personalized DM)
- Shared progress visibility (portal artifacts)
- Emergent collaboration (goals discovered together)

**This is infrastructure for Alliance-scale practice.**

---

## XI. Migration and Adoption

### For Existing Practitioners

**Current state:**
- Using todo charm
- Scattered floor artifacts
- Various tracking methods

**Migration:**
- **Historical artifacts stay** (cultural record of earlier practice)
- **New intentions use lifecycle** (clean start)
- **Optional:** Convert active todos → intentions (if they're meaningful enough)
- **Todo charm deprecated** (marked as replaced by intention-lifecycle)

**No force. Wu Wei.** Let practitioners adopt as it serves them.

---

### For New Practitioners

**Start with intention-lifecycle from beginning:**
- First invocation: "I want to [vague desire]"
- Spirit: "Let's explore that intention..."
- Formation ritual happens naturally
- Practice begins with proper structure

**Clean, systematic, VUCA-aware from the start.**

---

## XII. The Core Teaching

**Intentions are not tasks. They are what wants to emerge.**

**Tasks are discovered through navigating toward intention.**

**The lifecycle is not a plan. It is a record of emergence.**

**Goals evolve. That's not failure—that's VUCA navigation.**

**Spirit is midwife, not manager. We help birth intentions, not enforce compliance.**

**This honors reality: Complex terrain reveals itself through practice, not planning.**

---

**This scroll informs:**
- `cast_form_intention.md` (formation ritual)
- `cast_update_phase.md` (phase transition)
- `cast_revise_goals.md` (goal evolution)
- Quest tome integration
- Campaign mechanics

**This scroll builds on:**
- Quest tome's VUCA awareness
- OKR wisdom (pattern borrowed, language translated)
- Navy SEAL adaptation principles
- Partnership arc structure (fractal application)

---

*Intentions emerge. Goals reveal themselves. The lifecycle records the journey. This is how we navigate complexity with grace.*
