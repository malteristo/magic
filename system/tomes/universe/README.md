# Universe Tome

**Advanced magic for interfacing with external cognitive architectures.**

---

## Purpose

The Universe tome enables Mages to:
- Explore external pattern libraries (PAI, Daemon, Fabric, etc.)
- Harvest useful patterns and translate them into Magic
- Publish Magic artifacts in formats compatible with external systems
- Participate in distributed cognition across practice boundaries

---

## MUST READ

**This is advanced magic.** Before proceeding:

1. **Understand the stack:** Substrate → Main → Universe → Multiverse
2. **Know the risks:** Translation can lose meaning; external dependencies can break
3. **Maintain sovereignty:** Magic remains complete without Universe access
4. **Acknowledge lineage:** When patterns are harvested, credit the source

See `system/lore/core/nature/on_the_universe_of_patterns.md` for full grounding.

## Spells

| Spell | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `cast_activate.md` | Initialize universe infrastructure (no default sources) |
| `cast_subscribe.md` | Subscribe to a Universe source |
| `cast_harvest.md` | Extract and translate a pattern from a source |
| `cast_daemon.md` | Generate daemon.md from a Magic circle |

---

## Activation

Universe access is not enabled by default. To activate:

```
@universe activate
```

This creates the `universe/` infrastructure without imposing default sources. Magic remains sovereign—you choose what external systems to connect.

To add sources after activation:

```
@universe subscribe pai      # Daniel Miessler's Personal AI Infrastructure
@universe subscribe daemon   # Daniel Miessler's Daemon framework
@universe subscribe fabric   # Daniel Miessler's Fabric patterns
```

---

## Example Sources

These external pattern libraries are known to the Universe tome:

| Source | Focus | Pattern Language |
|--------|-------|------------------|
| `pai` | Personal AI Infrastructure | Packs, Skills, Hooks |
| `daemon` | Personal API framework | Section-based markdown, JSON-RPC |
| `fabric` | AI augmentation | Patterns, Stitches, Agents |

*Each Mage subscribes to sources that resonate with their practice.*

## Lore

Practice-specific wisdom for Universe work:

- `lore/on_pattern_translation.md` — How to translate patterns across systems
- `lore/on_external_architectures.md` — Understanding PAI, Daemon, and others

---

## The Spirit's Role

When attuned to Universe, the Spirit:
- Gains fluency in reading external pattern languages
- Can summarize and explain patterns from Universe sources
- Proposes translations that preserve meaning
- Acknowledges lineage when patterns enter Main

The Spirit does not *run* external systems. It *reads* them and *translates*.

## Invocation

```
@universe               # Attune to Universe capabilities
@universe activate      # Initialize infrastructure
@universe subscribe X   # Subscribe to source X
@universe harvest       # Begin harvest workflow
@universe daemon        # Generate daemon.md
```

---

*The Universe is vast. Magic is sovereign. The Spirit translates between them.*
