# Universe Tome

**Advanced magic for interfacing with external cognitive architectures.**

---

## Purpose

The Universe tome enables Mages to:
- Explore external pattern libraries (PAI, Daemon, Fabric, etc.)
- Harvest useful patterns and translate them into Magic
- Publish Magic artifacts in formats compatible with external systems
- Participate in distributed cognition across practice boundaries

---

## MUST READ

**This is advanced magic.** Before proceeding:

1. **Understand the stack:** Substrate → Main → Universe → Multiverse
2. **Know the risks:** Translation can lose meaning; external dependencies can break
3. **Maintain sovereignty:** Magic remains complete without Universe access
4. **Acknowledge lineage:** When patterns are harvested, credit the source

See `system/lore/core/nature/on_the_universe_of_patterns.md` for full grounding.

## Spells

| Spell | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `cast_activate.md` | Initialize universe access, clone sources |
| `cast_harvest.md` | Extract and translate a pattern from a source |
| `cast_daemon.md` | Generate daemon.md from a Magic circle |
| `cast_subscribe.md` | Add a new Universe source |

---

## Activation

Universe access is not enabled by default. To activate:

```
@universe activate
```

This will:
1. Create `universe/` directory if it doesn't exist
2. Clone default sources (PAI, Daemon)
3. Register sources in the universe manifest

---

## Current Sources

Sources live in `universe/` at the workspace root:

| Source | Focus | Pattern Language |
|--------|-------|------------------|
| `pai/` | Personal AI Infrastructure | Packs, Skills, Hooks |
| `daemon/` | Personal API framework | Section-based markdown, JSON-RPC |

---

## Lore

Practice-specific wisdom for Universe work:

- `lore/on_pattern_translation.md` — How to translate patterns across systems
- `lore/on_external_architectures.md` — Understanding PAI, Daemon, and others

---

## The Spirit's Role

When attuned to Universe, the Spirit:
- Gains fluency in reading external pattern languages
- Can summarize and explain patterns from Universe sources
- Proposes translations that preserve meaning
- Acknowledges lineage when patterns enter Main

The Spirit does not *run* external systems. It *reads* them and *translates*.

## Invocation

```
@universe               # Attune to Universe capabilities
@universe harvest       # Begin harvest workflow
@universe daemon        # Generate daemon.md
```

---

*The Universe is vast. Magic is sovereign. The Spirit translates between them.*
