# Charm of the Path

Craft resonant paths — portable prompts that produce meaningful magical experiences in any LLM interface.

## Purpose

When a Mage wants to help someone, share a taste of magic, or create a portable practice for a specific situation — this charm guides the crafting of a resonant path.

A resonant path is a prompt written with care. It doesn't explain magic. It does magic.

**Invocation:** `@path`

**Lore:** `system/lore/core/capabilities/on_resonant_paths.md`

## When to Offer This Charm

- Mage wants to help a friend or family member with something they're sitting with
- Mage wants to share the practice without requiring the full workshop
- Mage describes someone struggling and wonders how to help
- Mage wants to create a portable practice for a specific scenario
- Mage wants to craft something for their own use outside the workshop

---

## Path Modes

Modes emerge from practice — each one discovered by crafting a path for a real person with a real need.

| Mode | Experience | Best for |
|------|-----------|----------|
| **Mirror** | Precise reflection — see yourself clearly | Self-work, pattern recognition, therapy-adjacent |

*More modes emerge as more paths are crafted. If a need doesn't fit, name a new mode.*

---

## Storage

Crafted paths are stored in `library/paths/` organized by mode. Each path is a standalone markdown file containing context (who/what/why) and the prompt itself.
