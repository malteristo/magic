# Charm of the Path

Craft resonant paths — portable prompts that produce meaningful magical experiences in any LLM interface.

## Purpose

When a Mage wants to help someone, share a taste of magic, or create a portable practice for a specific situation — this charm guides the crafting of a resonant path.

A resonant path is a prompt written with care. It doesn't explain magic. It does magic.

**Invocation:** `@path`

**Lore:** `system/lore/core/capabilities/on_resonant_paths.md`

## When to Offer This Charm

- Mage wants to help a friend or family member with something they're sitting with
- Mage wants to share the practice without requiring the full workshop
- Mage describes someone struggling and wonders how to help
- Mage wants to create a portable practice for a specific scenario
- Mage wants to craft something for their own use outside the workshop

## Path Modes

| Mode | Experience | Best for |
|------|-----------|----------|
| **Mirror** | Precise reflection — see yourself clearly | Self-work, pattern recognition, therapy-adjacent |
| **Compass** | Decision clarity — see the landscape of a choice | Crossroads, ambivalence, competing goods |
| **Meaning** | Pattern recognition — connect what feels disconnected | Meaning crisis, life transitions, "what's it all for?" |
| **Release** | Emotional processing — feel what needs feeling | Grief, overwhelm, accumulated weight |
| **Focus** | Executive clarity — find the next right thing | Overwhelm, task paralysis, too many priorities |

Modes are starting points, not constraints. A path can blend modes or create new ones.

## Storage

Crafted paths are stored in `library/paths/` organized by mode. Each path is a standalone markdown file containing context (who/what/why) and the prompt itself.
