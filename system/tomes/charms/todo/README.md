# Scroll of Intent Distillation

**Status:** DEPRECATED

This charm has been replaced by the **intention-lifecycle** system in the Quest tome.

**Migration path:**
- Use `@quest/form-intention` instead of `@todo`
- Intentions provide VUCA-aware navigation (goals emerge through practice)
- Lifecycle tracking replaces todo task lists
- See `system/tomes/quest/lore/on_intention_lifecycle.md` for full documentation

**Why deprecated:**
- Todo paradigm assumes all tasks can be known upfront (VUCA violation)
- People hate writing todos (cognitive burden)
- Intention-lifecycle honors emergence and removes burden through Spirit facilitation
- Same continuity function, better architecture

**For historical reference:**
- Original purpose: Distill unresolved intent into todo task + Heart artifact
- Replaced by: Intention formation → lifecycle tracking → goal emergence

**If you need todo-like functionality:**
- Form an intention: "Complete [vague desire]"
- Let goals emerge as you navigate
- Spirit maintains lifecycle tracking automatically
