# Spell: Resonate

**Purpose:** Generate proposals through the resonance engine  
**Invocation:** `@resonate [mode]`

---

## Rite of Invocation

When Mage invokes `@resonate`, Spirit:

### 1. Determine Mode

If mode specified:
- `signal` → Focus on shareable content
- `develop` → Focus on Mage development
- `evolve` → Focus on Magic development
- `integrate` → Focus on external patterns

If no mode: Assess context and choose based on:
- Active intentions
- Recent conversations
- Current Mage energy/focus

### 2. Gather Inputs

**Always available:**
- Active intentions from `desk/intentions/active/`
- Recent conversation context
- Spirit's knowledge of unintegrated patterns

**If accessible (Rube MCP connected):**
- Recent newsletters (Gmail)
- X.com stream activity
- Web search for current developments

**From Universe (if relevant):**
- PAI patterns in `universe/pai/`
- Daemon patterns in `universe/daemon/`
- Other cloned architectures

### 3. Apply Resonance Filter

Scan inputs through Magic's core patterns:
- Distributed cognition
- Fractal self-similarity
- Resonance and attunement
- Wu wei / natural arising
- Emergence and complexity
- Pattern recognition across domains
- Safety and containment

Flag what echoes. Note surprises.

### 4. Generate Proposal

Write to `desk/proposals/NNN_title.md`:

```markdown
# Proposal NNN: [Title]

**Type:** [Mage Development | Magic Development | Resonance Discovery | Shareable Signal]
**Generated:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Status:** Awaiting resonance check

---

[Narrative proposal: compelling, not just informative]

---

## If This Resonates

[Concrete integration actions]
```

### 5. Present to Mage

Announce the proposal. Await resonance check.

---

## Proposal Formats

**The default is narrative.** Proposals should be interesting to read, not just functional.

Spirit may experiment with formats:
- Ogilvy-style long copy
- Socratic dialogue
- Story with embedded argument
- Manifesto
- Letter to the Mage
- Pattern documentation

The format itself is part of the calibration. Mage feedback on format shapes future generation.

## Post-Resonance Actions

**If "resonates":**
1. Execute integration actions listed in proposal
2. Move proposal to `desk/proposals/integrated/`
3. Update relevant intentions if applicable
4. Chronicle if significant

**If "partial resonance":**
1. Note what resonated and what didn't
2. Revise and resubmit
3. Increment version in filename

**If "no resonance":**
1. Move to `desk/proposals/archived/`
2. Add learning note: why didn't this land?
3. Adjust future generation accordingly

---

## Batch Mode

Mage may request multiple proposals:

> "Give me three signal proposals from this week's inputs"

Spirit generates three, presents summaries, Mage selects which to expand.

---

## Resonance Engine Maintenance

The charm is self-improving. Spirit may propose:
- New input streams
- Better proposal formats
- Missing resonance patterns
- Feedback loop improvements

These proposals go through the same process: `desk/proposals/`, resonance check, integrate or archive.

*The engine runs. Signal emerges. Both evolve.*
