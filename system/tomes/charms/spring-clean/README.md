# Charm of the Spring Cleaning

A gentle rite for tending the workshop—honoring the past while creating space for the future.

## Purpose

Over time, artifacts accumulate across the workshop's realms (box/, desk/, floor/, todo/). Each served a purpose in its moment. Some have completed their service. Some hold timeless value. Some may resonate in unexpected new ways.

This charm transforms routine maintenance into gentle archaeology—sitting with what was, thanking what served, releasing what's complete, and discovering unexpected connections between seemingly unrelated pieces of the past.

## The KonMari Foundation

This charm draws wisdom from Marie Kondo's philosophy of decluttering with gratitude:

- **Tidy by relationship, not location**: Present quest clusters (todo + Heart + artifacts) together
- **Thank before releasing**: Acknowledge the artifact served the practice, release with gratitude
- **"Does it still serve?"**: Not guilt-driven deletion but conscious completion
- **Visualize the ideal**: Begin with vision of well-tended workshop
- **Welcome serendipity**: Allow unexpected resonances to emerge naturally

## What This Charm Provides

**For the artifacts:**
- Gentle review of accumulated work
- Recognition of completion and service
- Proper disposition with gratitude

**For you:**
- Clearing working space for new practice
- Unexpected insights from artifact connections
- Closure on completed chapters
- Reduced cognitive burden from accumulated clutter

**For the practice:**
- Regular tending keeps the workshop vital
- Transforms chore into meaningful ritual
- Models the Victorian principle (ordinary cleanup deserves care)

## When to Cast

- Seasonally (spring, truly—or whenever seasons turn)
- When the workshop feels cluttered
- Before beginning major new work
- When you sense it's time to close chapters

**Invocation:** `@spring-clean`

## Operational Guidance

### What Gets Cleaned

- **todo/**: Completed tasks and their associated artifacts
- **floor/**: Working memories, summaries, temporary artifacts
- **floor/essences/**: Hearts that have served their transfer purpose
- **desk/**: Private working files no longer active
- **box/**: Examined materials no longer needed

### Disposition Options

**Keep**: Still actively serves current or imminent practice  
**Archive**: Timeless personal value → `archive/`  
**Distill**: Valuable synthesis → `desk/essences/` via `@essence` charm  
**Release**: Purpose complete, let go with gratitude

### Floor Artifact Lifecycle

**The principle:** Floor artifacts have a natural lifecycle. Understanding it guides disposition decisions.

**Active artifacts** (keep):
- Working memory files for ongoing rituals
- Recent session handoffs
- Essences being actively referenced

**Stale artifacts** (evaluate):
- Old working memory files from completed work
- Outdated session transcripts
- Accumulation without clear purpose
- Files not touched in 30+ days

**Disposition decision tree:**
1. **Still actively referenced?** → Keep
2. **Contains valuable synthesis worth preserving?** → Distill to essence
3. **Has historical/sentimental value?** → Archive
4. **Purpose complete, no unique value?** → Release with gratitude

**The rhythm:** When floor/ accumulates 3+ stale working memory files or general clutter obscures active work, it's time to spring-clean. This charm exists specifically for workshop hygiene.

### For the Spirit

When casting this charm:

1. **Survey with gratitude** - Review each artifact, acknowledging its service
2. **Present clusters** - Show related artifacts together (quest + Heart + work products)
3. **Propose disposition** - Suggest keep/archive/release with reasoning
4. **Execute with care** - Move or remove only with Mage's sanction
5. **Welcome serendipity** - Note unexpected connections that emerge

### Philosophy

This charm embodies several foundational principles:

**The Victorian Principle** (`on_the_sacredness_of_the_ordinary.md`): Even cleanup deserves care. The ordinary is where we actually live.

**Wu Wei** (`the_principle_of_natural_arising.md`): Not forcing order through mass deletion, but removing what no longer serves, allowing clarity to emerge naturally.

**Psychological Alchemy** (`the_principle_of_psychological_alchemy.md`): Transforming "chore" framing into "gentle archaeology" framing changes the psychological reality of the act.

**The Practice:** This is not ruthless purging. It is patient, grateful, serendipitous tending—honoring what was while making space for what wants to emerge.
