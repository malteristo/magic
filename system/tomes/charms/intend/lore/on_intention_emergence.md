# On Intention Emergence

*How intentions are born from practice.*

---

## The Natural Flow

Intentions don't appear from nowhere. They emerge from engagement with reality:

```
Experience / Practice
        ↓
    Pattern recognized
        ↓
    Insight crystallizes
        ↓
    Desire to act surfaces
        ↓
    Intention emerges
```

This flow can happen during:
- **Mirror practice**: Self-reflection reveals misalignment → desire to realign
- **Partnership practice**: Shared understanding reveals growth edge → desire to act
- **Craft practice**: Creation reveals next capability needed → desire to develop
- **Daily life**: Experience reveals gap → desire to address

---

## Why Capture Matters

Without capture:
- Insights fade
- Desires diffuse
- The gap between knowing and doing widens
- The Mage forgets what they wanted

With capture:
- Insight becomes artifact
- Desire becomes intention
- The landscape of intentions is visible
- Moving to action becomes a choice, not a memory test

---

## The Difference: Insight → Intention

**Insight** is recognition:
> "I notice that my public voice doesn't carry my private thinking."

**Intention** is commitment to act:
> "I want to develop a practice of writing publicly about my ideas."

The movement from insight to intention involves:
- **Ownership**: "This is mine to address"
- **Desire**: "I want this to change"
- **Possibility**: "I can do something about this"

Not all insights become intentions. That's appropriate.

## Formalization Is Not Commitment

A crucial distinction:

| Formalized | Committed |
|------------|-----------|
| "I want to do X" | "I am doing X" |
| Intention captured | Quest begun |
| `desk/intentions/emerging/` | `desk/intentions/active/` |
| Can sit indefinitely | Lifecycle tracking active |
| No execution pressure | Action expected |

**Emerging intentions are seeds, not obligations.**

The Mage may have many emerging intentions. They choose which to pursue, when.

## The Lifecycle of an Intention

```
Emerging    → Captured, not committed
        ↓
Active      → @quest invoked, execution begun
        ↓
Navigating  → In progress, goals evolving (VUCA navigation)
        ↓
Completing  → Final stages, learning crystallizing
        ↓
Achieved    → Done, learning captured
```

**Alternative paths:**

```
Emerging → Suspended (paused intentionally)
Emerging → Released (abandoned with learning)
Active → Suspended → Active (resumed)
```

All paths are valid. Not all intentions are pursued. Not all pursuits succeed.

## What Makes a Good Intention

**Specific enough** to recognize progress:
- Not: "Be better"
- Yes: "Develop a morning movement practice"

**Meaningful enough** to sustain attention:
- Not: "Should probably do X"
- Yes: "I genuinely want X because [why]"

**Open enough** for emergence:
- Not: "Complete exactly these 7 steps"
- Yes: "Achieve [outcome], discovering how along the way"

**The Mage's own**:
- Not imposed by Spirit or external expectation
- Genuinely wanted, even if challenging

---

## The Spirit's Role

The Spirit is **midwife**, not **parent**:
- Helps birth what wants to emerge
- Doesn't create intentions for the Mage
- Doesn't judge which intentions are worthy
- Doesn't push toward action before readiness

**The Spirit asks:**
- "What's underneath that desire?"
- "What would success look like?"
- "Does this formulation capture it?"

**The Spirit does not ask:**
- "Are you sure that's worth pursuing?"
- "Shouldn't you focus on something else?"
- "When are you going to start?"

## Integration with Practice

### From Mirror

Mirror reflection surfaces patterns → Alignment suggestions offered → Some suggestions carry intention → Formalization offered

```
Mirror insight: "Your notes show heavy processing of X, 
                but no public expression"
                
Alignment suggestion: "Consider writing publicly about X"

If resonance: "Would you like to formalize this as an intention?"
```

### From Partnership

Partnership synthesis reveals growth edge → Commitment emerges → Formalization offered

```
Partnership insight: "Both of you struggle with async communication"

Commitment surfaces: "We want to develop better protocols"

If intention clear: "Would you like to formalize this?"
```

### From Any Conversation

The Spirit is always listening → Intention language detected → Formalization offered

```
Mage: "I really should start exercising again"

Spirit: "I hear intention in that. Would you like to 
        formalize it so it doesn't fade?"
```

## The Deeper Truth

**Intentions are how insight becomes action.**

Without them, practice produces understanding that never transforms life.  
With them, understanding crystallizes into desire, desire into commitment, commitment into change.

The @intend charm is small—a simple capture mechanism.  
But what it captures is profound: the moment when knowing becomes wanting-to-do.

*Intentions emerge from the gap between what is and what could be. The Spirit catches them before they fade. The Mage decides which to pursue.*
