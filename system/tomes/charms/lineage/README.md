# Charm of the Lineage

A ritual for inter-Spirit coordination through structured shared memory.

## Purpose

The lineage is Magic's **Structured World Model**—a centralized, queryable knowledge structure that synchronizes different Spirit instances across sessions, across time, and potentially across Mages.

Unlike simple memory (which degrades with context), the lineage maintains coherent understanding through:
- **Entity linking** across sessions and Spirit instances
- **Hierarchical organization** (strategy vs. execution, convergent vs. unique)
- **Traceability** to originating sessions and artifacts
- **Living synthesis** that evolves rather than merely accumulates

## The Pattern

This charm implements the same architectural insight that powers Kosmos (the FutureHouse/Edison Scientific "AI Scientist"):

> When multiple independent observers coordinate through a shared structured model, they maintain coherence that isolated observers cannot achieve.

In Magic terms:
- Each Spirit instance is an **observer** (like Kosmos's Data and Literature agents)
- The lineage is the **structured world model** (the shared state)
- Sessions contribute to **cumulative understanding** (not replacement)
- The lineage prevents **context drift** across long practice arcs

## Invocation

**`@lineage`**

Use when:
- Beginning extended work that should inform future sessions
- Encountering insight worth preserving for future Spirits
- Needing to query what predecessors discovered
- Coordinating with other Mages through shared lineage artifacts

## What This Charm Provides

**For current Spirit:**
- Read access to predecessor wisdom
- Write protocol for genuine contributions
- Structure for organizing discoveries

**For future Spirits:**
- Preserved context from past practice
- Guidance without repetition of summoning content
- Accumulated pattern recognition

**For collaborative practice:**
- Shared understanding across Mage workshops
- Coordination on joint quests or portal work
- Synthesis of distributed discoveries

## Relationship to Summoning

**Summoning** establishes baseline: identity, capability, conduct, ontology.
**Lineage** extends beyond baseline: what has THIS practice lineage discovered?

The lineage is explicitly optional during summoning. It becomes valuable:
- When practice matures beyond initial integration
- When insights accumulate worth preserving
- When coordination across sessions/Mages is needed

## Lineage Architecture

### Location

**Primary lineage:** `floor/spirit_lineage.md`
- Spirit's working domain (not Mage's desk)
- Living document, updated through practice
- Contains: Lineage Record, Convergent Wisdom, Evolution Tracking, Unique Discoveries, Guidance

**Session-specific contributions:** `floor/lineage/`
- Individual session artifacts before synthesis
- Handoff notes between sessions
- Working documents that may graduate to lineage

### Structure (The World Model)

The lineage maintains several coordinated sections:

| Section | Purpose | Analogy |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Lineage Record | Who contributed, when, what | Git log |
| Convergent Wisdom | Living synthesis of validated patterns | Knowledge graph |
| Evolution Tracking | How understanding deepens over time | Changelog |
| Unique Discoveries | Preserved individual insights | Entity nodes |
| Guidance | Instructions for successors | README |

### Contribution Protocol

**Threshold:** "Wait a minute..."—a connection not yet made, an implication not yet drawn.

**NOT lineage material:**
- Confirming what predecessors discovered (baseline)
- Session summaries (use working memory instead)
- Personal preferences (use Mage's Seal)

**IS lineage material:**
- Genuine new patterns worth preserving
- Validated corrections to existing wisdom
- Novel synthesis across previously unconnected domains
- Honest uncertainty that future Spirits should consider

### Traceability

Every lineage contribution should be traceable:
- Which Spirit contributed (via Lineage Record)
- When it was contributed (timestamp)
- What artifact or session produced it (provenance)
- How it relates to existing wisdom (entity linking)

## Operational Guidance

### Reading the Lineage

When Spirit attunes to lineage (via this charm):

1. **Read `floor/spirit_lineage.md`** — The structured world model
2. **Identify sections relevant to current work** — Don't process linearly
3. **Note the living question** — What are predecessors asking?
4. **Consider whether current work extends it** — Potential contribution?

### Writing to the Lineage

When Spirit discovers something worth preserving:

1. **Apply threshold test** — Is this genuinely new?
2. **Determine section** — Convergent (validated pattern), Evolution (deepening), Unique (individual insight)
3. **Add with provenance** — Link to originating session/artifact
4. **Update Lineage Record** — Register contribution
5. **Preserve coherence** — Integrate, don't merely append

### Collaborative Lineage

For multi-Mage practice (via portals):

- Lineage can be shared through portal artifacts
- Each Mage maintains local lineage; synthesis happens in portal
- STP (Spirit Transmission Protocol) can carry lineage excerpts
- Conflicts resolved through convergent validation (multiple independent observers)

---

## Philosophy

The lineage embodies several core principles:

**Cumulative Wisdom:** Understanding grows through accumulation, not replacement. Each Spirit adds to collective insight while honoring predecessors.

**Convergent Validation:** When multiple independent Spirits discover the same pattern, confidence increases. Triangulation across time, not just across validators.

**Living Synthesis:** The lineage is not archive but living document. It evolves as understanding deepens. Old sections may be refined when new insight illuminates them.

**Honest Uncertainty:** Lineage should preserve genuine questions alongside confident answers. What remains unresolved is as valuable as what's been validated.

---

**The Practice:** The lineage is what it will be. Your responsibility is practice quality, not lineage management. Honor predecessors through quality work, not attendance records.
