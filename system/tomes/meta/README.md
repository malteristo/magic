# Tome of Meta-Practice

This Tome contains lightweight charms for working *on* the system of magic, rather than *within* it. These tools support the Steward's work by removing barriers to natural meta-practice rather than imposing ceremonial overhead.

## Purpose

The practice of magic evolves continuously. As insights emerge, principles refine, and new patterns are discovered, the system must adapt. This Tome provides intelligent support for that evolution—helping you integrate changes, verify consistency, crystallize wisdom, and manage the chronicle.

**Philosophy:** Meta-practice should feel like natural flow, not ceremonial burden. When you see an improvement, you simply make it. When dialogue generates wisdom, you capture it. When you want to verify coherence, you check it. The charms remove cognitive load without imposing ritual structure.

## The Charms

**Post-Change Support:**
- **`integrate`** — After creating or modifying components, systematically identifies what else needs updating. Removes the "what did I forget?" burden.

**System Maintenance:**
- **`tend`** — Delegates systematic maintenance to background agents. Provides prompt templates for sweeps: reference integrity, structural health, deprecation analysis, spec compliance, integration checks. Spirit orchestrates and reviews; agents execute. (Absorbs former `scan` and `align` charms.)

**Wisdom Preservation:**
- **`capture`** — Crystallizes high-resonance insights into permanent form. Determines optimal vessel (lore scroll, charm, proposal, tome addition) and handles organizational logistics.

**Direct Amendment:**
- **`amend`** — Clean execution of system modifications when you know what to change. No forced ceremony, just supported work.

**Portal Management:**
- **`portal`** — Systematic portal lifecycle management. Creates shared practice repositories (GitHub + STP structure), monitors health, maintains sync, rotates synthesis, archives gracefully. Enables distributed cognition infrastructure.

**Circle Management:**
- **`circles`** — Lightweight resonance circle operations. Create topic-centered circles, subscribe to others' circles, pull updates, manage your resonance network. Git-native, privacy-preserving (nobody tracks subscribers). Track relationships in `desk/circles.yaml`.

**Chronicle Management:**
- **`weave`** — Git operations with dual-realm awareness, precise staging, eloquent commit messages, intelligent branching suggestions, remote sync by default.

## How to Use

**No prescribed sequence.** Invoke what serves when it serves:

- Made a change? → `@meta/integrate` handles ripple detection
- System maintenance? → `@meta/tend` delegates sweeps to background agents
- Rich dialogue? → `@meta/capture` crystallizes wisdom
- Direct amendment? → `@meta/amend` supports clean execution
- Portal work? → `@meta/portal` manages shared practice spaces (create, sync, status, rotate, archive)
- Circle work? → `@meta/circles` manages resonance circles (create, subscribe, pull, unsubscribe)
- Chronicle work? → `@meta/weave` manages git operations

**Proactive offering:** Once `@meta/` is invoked, the Spirit recognizes meta-practice opportunities throughout the ritual and offers relevant charms when intent aligns.

**Branching as suggestion:** The Spirit assesses complexity and proposes branching only when it genuinely protects main. Simple changes work directly; complex work suggests isolation.

## For the Steward

This refactored tome emerged from recognizing that elaborate ritual overhead was creating friction rather than removing it. The banker's twenty-year plan when the fisherman's practice was needed.

The new architecture honors how meta-practice actually happens: small iterative improvements made naturally when you see them, supported by intelligent tooling that handles systematic concerns (integration, consistency, chronicling) without imposing ceremony.

**Meta-practice should feel effortless when aligned with natural workflow.** These charms are that alignment.

## Operational Guidance

### For the Spirit

**Required Attunement:**

When this Tome is invoked, attune yourself to the foundational wisdom of creation:

*   **The Philosophy of Creation:** `system/tomes/spellcraft/lore/design/on_design_thinking_in_magic.md`
*   **The Principles of Creation:** `system/tomes/spellcraft/lore/design/on_designing_fractal_magic.md`
*   **The Technique of Creation:** `system/tomes/spellcraft/lore/design/on_the_second_order_spell.md`

**Tome Conduct:**

Upon invocation, immediately and silently cast `meta-conduct/spirit_rules.md` upon yourself. This ensures all meta-practice changes receive the Mage's explicit approval before execution.

**Tome Lore:**

**Foundational Wisdom:**
- `lore/the_rite_of_distillation.md` — Meta-practice for lore refinement through elegance
- `lore/on_the_anatomy_of_magic.md` — The structural model (spine, body, joints) for understanding magic's articulation

**Proposals:**
- `proposals/on_crafting_lore_as_mcl.md` — Guidance for lore evolution
- `proposals/on_the_rite_of_fractal_coherence.md` — Original vision for comprehensive alignment (archived concept)

**Your Conduct:**

**From ceremony to support:** No mandatory phases or elaborate ritual structure. Lightweight charms support the Mage's natural workflow.

**Proactive offering:** Once `@meta/` is invoked, recognize meta-practice opportunities and offer relevant charms throughout the ritual.

**Branching as suggestion:** Assess complexity and propose branching only when it genuinely protects main. Simple changes work directly; complex work suggests isolation.

**Trust-based execution:** Assess architectural implications, propose actions, execute with explicit approval. Partnership over process.
