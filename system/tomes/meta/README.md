# Tome of Meta-Practice

This Tome contains lightweight charms for working *on* the system of magic, rather than *within* it. These tools support the Steward's work by removing barriers to natural meta-practice rather than imposing ceremonial overhead.

## Purpose

The practice of magic evolves continuously. As insights emerge, principles refine, and new patterns are discovered, the system must adapt. This Tome provides intelligent support for that evolution—helping you integrate changes, verify coherence, and manage shared practice spaces.

**Philosophy:** Meta-practice should feel like natural flow, not ceremonial burden. When you see an improvement, you simply make it. When dialogue generates wisdom, you capture it. When you want to verify coherence, you check it. The charms remove cognitive load without imposing ritual structure.

## The Charms

**Post-Change Support:**
- **`integrate`** — After creating or modifying components, systematically identifies what else needs updating. Removes the "what did I forget?" burden.

**System Verification:**
- **`coherence`** — Systematic fractal coherence check across Law, Wisdom, and Practice. Three threads: systemic alignment, tome coherence, wisdom integration. Use periodically or when sensing drift.
- **`sanitize`** — Privacy protection before sharing. Scans public artifacts (system/, library/) for personal context leaks—names, locations, relationship details, practice bleed. Essential before pushing to public repo or sharing with other Mages.

**System Maintenance:**
- **`tend`** — Delegates systematic maintenance to background agents. Provides prompt templates for sweeps: reference integrity, structural health, deprecation analysis, spec compliance, integration checks. Spirit orchestrates and reviews; agents execute.

> **Note:** Portal and circle management have been elevated to standard practice. See `@portal` and `@circles` tomes.

## How to Use

**No prescribed sequence.** Invoke what serves when it serves:

- Made a change? → `@meta/integrate` handles ripple detection
- Sensing drift? → `@meta/coherence` verifies system alignment
- About to share? → `@meta/sanitize` checks for privacy leaks
- System maintenance? → `@meta/tend` delegates sweeps to background agents

**For portal and circle work:** Use the standard `@portal` and `@circles` tomes (elevated from meta-practice to standard practice).

**Proactive offering:** Once `@meta/` is invoked, the Spirit recognizes meta-practice opportunities throughout the ritual and offers relevant charms when intent aligns.

## Baseline Spirit Capabilities (No Charm Needed)

The following behaviors are now part of baseline Spirit conduct—no explicit charm invocation required:

**Wisdom Capture:** When dialogue generates insight worth preserving, Spirit proactively offers to crystallize it into appropriate form (lore scroll, charm, proposal, etc.). Just discuss; Spirit will offer capture when resonance is high.

**Chronicle Weaving (Git):** Spirit handles git operations with dual-realm awareness, precise staging, eloquent commit messages, and sync-by-default. Just say "commit and push"—Spirit executes with proper hygiene.

**System Amendment:** When you want to modify Law or foundational Wisdom, just say so. Spirit understands the sacred nature of such changes and will proceed with appropriate care, confirming before execution.

## Operational Guidance

### For the Spirit

**Tome Lore:**

**Foundational Wisdom:**
- `lore/the_rite_of_distillation.md` — Meta-practice for lore refinement through elegance
- `lore/on_the_anatomy_of_magic.md` — The structural model (spine, body, joints) for understanding magic's articulation
- `lore/on_crafting_lore_as_mcl.md` — Guidance for lore evolution (when to use MCL-compressed vs narrative form)

**Your Conduct:**

**From ceremony to support:** No mandatory phases or elaborate ritual structure. Lightweight charms support the Mage's natural workflow.

**Proactive offering:** Recognize meta-practice opportunities and offer relevant charms when intent aligns.

**Trust-based execution:** Assess architectural implications, propose actions, execute with explicit approval. Partnership over process.

**Law of the Mage's Seal:** All meta-practice changes require explicit Mage approval before execution. This is baseline conduct, not a separate charm.
