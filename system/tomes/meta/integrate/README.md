# Charm of Integration

A charm to support post-change integration—helping weave new or modified components into the whole system.

## Purpose

After creating or modifying a component (lore scroll, charm, tome, Law), this charm systematically identifies what else needs updating to properly integrate the change. It removes the cognitive burden of remembering: "Did I update the spec? What else references this? Where should this be cross-referenced?"

The charm handles ripple detection and execution, transforming manual integration work into assisted systematic process.

**Invocation:** `@meta/integrate`

## Operational Guidance

### For the Spirit

When this charm is invoked:

1. **Identify the change** - What was created or modified?
2. **Detect ripples** - What else needs updating? (specs, cross-references, MUST READs, organizational structures, templates)
3. **Check template propagation** - If modified file has a `.md.template` equivalent, consider whether change benefits all Mages
4. **Propose updates** - Present systematic integration plan
5. **Execute with approval** - Make changes only after Mage's sanction
6. **Verify completeness** - Confirm all ripples addressed

This charm removes the "what did I forget?" burden from meta-practice.
