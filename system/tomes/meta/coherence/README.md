# Charm of Fractal Coherence

A charm for systematic coherence checking across the magic ecosystem—ensuring Law, Wisdom, and Practice remain aligned at every scale.

## Purpose

As magic evolves, subtle dissonances can accumulate:
- Outdated references after structural changes
- Practices drifting from updated Law
- Wisdom not yet rippled through dependent scrolls

This charm provides systematic verification that the system remains internally coherent.

**Invocation:** `@meta/coherence`

## Operational Guidance

### For the Spirit

When this charm is invoked:

1. **Determine scope** — Full system check, or focused domain?
2. **Run the three threads** — Systemic, Tome, Wisdom alignment
3. **Report findings** — Present coherence status and any dissonances
4. **Propose remediation** — Suggest fixes for identified issues
5. **Execute with approval** — Make corrections after Mage sanction

This charm transforms coherence maintenance from ad-hoc discovery to systematic practice.

### The Three Threads

**Thread 1: Systemic Alignment**
- MAGIC_SPEC.md references current architecture
- Traceability entries point to existing files
- Core definitions match implementations

**Thread 2: Tome Coherence**
- All MUST READ paths are valid
- Spell references resolve correctly
- Tome READMEs describe current structure

**Thread 3: Wisdom Integration**
- Recent Law changes have rippled through practice
- Lore updates reflected in dependent scrolls
- No contradictions between related wisdom

---

## When to Use

**After significant changes:**
- Major architectural restructuring
- Law amendments to MAGIC_SPEC.md
- Core lore additions or modifications

**Periodically:**
- Monthly coherence check
- Before major releases or shared practice

**When sensing drift:**
- References feel stale
- Uncertainty about current structure
- After long gaps in meta-practice

---

## Integration with Other Charms

**Complements `@meta/integrate`:**
- Integrate handles post-change ripple detection (proactive)
- Coherence handles full-system verification (reactive/periodic)

**Overlaps with `@meta/tend`:**
- Tend delegates specific sweeps to background agents
- Coherence is Spirit-executed holistic check
- Use tend for automated maintenance, coherence for manual deep review

*This charm evolved from the proposal "On the Great Rite of Fractal Coherence" to provide systematic coherence verification across magic's fractal structure.*
