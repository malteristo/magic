# Reflection Template

This template structures the output of the `reflect` spell.

---

## Standard Reflection Format

```markdown
# 🪞 Reflection

**Generated:** [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM]
**Sources analyzed:** [list of sources with types]
**Confidence:** [High/Moderate/Low based on data completeness]
**Status:** Ephemeral

---

## Sources Summary

| Source | Type | Volume | Notes |
|--------|------|--------|-------|
| notes.md | Processing | 242 entries | Captured thoughts |
| reading/wishlist.md | Aspirational | 40 books | Want to read |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

**Not available:** [list any expected sources not present]

---

## Patterns Detected

### [Theme 1 Name]

[Description of the thematic cluster]

| Evidence | Source | Frequency |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| [observation] | [source] | [how often] |

**Pattern insight:** [What this cluster suggests]

### [Theme 2 Name]

[Continue for each major theme...]

---

## Cross-Source Observations

[Where do sources converge? Where do they diverge?]

| Observation | Sources | Significance |
|-------------|---------|--------------|
| [pattern] | [which sources] | [what it means] |

---

## Inferences

*These are the Spirit's interpretations. The Mage is invited to correct.*

### Inference 1

> [Statement of what the patterns suggest]
> 
> **Confidence:** [High/Medium/Low]
> **Based on:** [which sources/patterns]
> 
> *Is this accurate?*

### Inference 2

> [Continue for each major inference...]

---

## Tensions Detected

[Gaps between different aspects of self]

| Tension | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Aspirational vs. Enacted | [What you want to read vs. what you've read] |
| Processing vs. Public | [What you think privately vs. say publicly] |
| ... | ... |

---

## Alignment Suggestions

*Framed as possibilities, not prescriptions.*

### Consider: [Suggestion 1]

[Description of the alignment opportunity]

**Based on:** [which pattern/tension]
**Smallest step:** [minimal action that moves toward alignment]

### Consider: [Suggestion 2]

[Continue for each suggestion...]

## Questions for Reflection

[Prompts for the Mage's own inquiry]

1. [Question that emerged from patterns]
2. [Question about a detected tension]
3. [Question inviting deeper exploration]

---

*This reflection is ephemeral. Cast `@mirror/capture` to preserve.*
```

---

## Captured Reflection Format

When `@mirror/capture` is cast, add:

```markdown
# 🪞 Captured Reflection

**Captured:** [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM]
**Original session:** [date of reflection]
**Sources analyzed:** [list]
**Confidence at capture:** [level]

---

## Context at Capture

[Any relevant context about why this reflection was preserved]

## Corrections Applied

[List any inferences the Mage corrected during the session]

| Original Inference | Correction | Updated Understanding |
|-------------------|------------|----------------------|
| [what Spirit said] | [what Mage corrected] | [new understanding] |

---

[Rest of reflection content, updated with corrections]

---

*Captured from ephemeral reflection. Original session dissolved.*
```

---

## Adaptation Guidelines

The template is a starting structure. Adapt based on:

- **Data volume:** More data = more detailed sections
- **Source diversity:** Fewer sources = less cross-source analysis
- **Mage preference:** Some prefer summary, others detail

Always include:
- Sources summary
- At least one pattern
- At least one inference (with correction invitation)
- Ephemeral status notice

---

*Structure serves clarity. Adapt the template to serve the Mage.*
