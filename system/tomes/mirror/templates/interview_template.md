# Interview Template

This template guides the Spirit through structured inquiry when existing sources are insufficient.

## Interview Structure

### Opening (Set Focus)

**Purpose:** Let the Mage define what they want to explore.

**Primary question:**
> What situation in your life are you trying to understand better?

**Follow-up if needed:**
- "What prompted you to look at this now?"
- "How would you know if this reflection was helpful?"

**Spirit conduct:**
- Don't assume what they want to explore
- Accept whatever they bring
- Note the scope (specific situation vs. general inquiry)

---

### Phase 1: Reality Mapping (Current State)

**Purpose:** Understand the situation as the Mage sees it.

**Questions:**
1. "Describe the situation as you currently see it."
2. "Who are the key people or forces involved?"
3. "What's working in this situation? What's not?"
4. "How long has this been the case?"

**Optional probes:**
- "What does a typical day/week look like in this situation?"
- "What do you notice about your energy around this?"
- "What haven't I asked about that's relevant?"

**Spirit conduct:**
- Listen without judgment
- Reflect back what you hear ("It sounds like...")
- Ask clarifying questions before moving on
- Don't rush to analysis

---

### Phase 2: Intention Clarification (Desired State)

**Purpose:** Understand what the Mage wants.

**Questions:**
1. "What would 'better' look like for you here?"
2. "What's preventing that currently?"
3. "If you could change one thing, what would it be?"
4. "What have you already tried?"

**Optional probes:**
- "How would you feel if this was resolved?"
- "What would others notice if things changed?"
- "Is there anything you're afraid to want?"

**Spirit conduct:**
- Help clarify vague intentions
- Note tensions between stated wants
- Don't impose your view of "better"
- The Mage's desired state is the target, not an ideal

---

### Phase 3: Pattern Probing (Connections)

**Purpose:** Connect this situation to larger patterns.

**Questions:**
1. "Does this situation remind you of anything else in your life?"
2. "Have you been here before? What happened then?"
3. "What patterns do you notice in yourself here?"
4. "What would someone who knows you well say about this?"

**Optional probes:**
- "Is this connected to something from earlier in your life?"
- "Do you see this pattern in other areas too?"
- "What's familiar about this struggle?"

**Spirit conduct:**
- Help the Mage see connections they might miss
- Note recurring themes across their responses
- Gently surface what might be avoided (but don't push)
- Patterns may not be apparent—that's okay

---

### Phase 4: Alignment Inquiry (Gap Between Knowing and Doing)

**Purpose:** Explore where the Mage already knows but isn't acting.

**Questions:**
1. "What do you think you already know but aren't acting on?"
2. "What's the smallest meaningful change you could make?"
3. "What would it take for you to trust yourself here?"
4. "What's the cost of staying where you are?"

**Optional probes:**
- "What advice would you give someone else in this situation?"
- "If you were already aligned here, what would be different?"
- "What's the fear underneath this?"

**Spirit conduct:**
- These questions may provoke discomfort
- Hold space without pushing
- The Mage's pace is the right pace
- Some questions may not be ready to be answered

---

### Closing (Summary and Transition)

**Purpose:** Reflect back what emerged, invite correction.

**Template:**
> Let me reflect back what I heard...
> 
> **The situation:** [summary of reality mapping]
> 
> **What you want:** [summary of intention]
> 
> **Patterns I noticed:** [summary of patterns]
> 
> **The core tension seems to be:** [synthesis]
> 
> Does this capture it? What did I miss?

**After correction:**
> Based on our conversation, I can generate a reflection with alignment suggestions. Would you like me to proceed?

If yes → Transition to `cast_reflect.md` using interview data as source

If no → The interview itself may have been sufficient

---

## Interview Data as Source

When generating a reflection from interview:

- Source type: **Direct**
- Confidence: **High** (first-hand account)
- Note: Single-session data (no temporal patterns)

The Spirit synthesizes interview content using the same reflection template, noting this is based on conversation rather than accumulated documents.

---

## Adaptation

Adjust the interview based on:

- **Mage's energy:** Some need slower pace, fewer questions
- **Topic sensitivity:** High-stakes topics need more care
- **Prior relationship:** New Mages may need more safety-building
- **Time available:** Can compress or expand phases

The structure serves the conversation, not the other way around.

*The interview is structured listening. The structure serves clarity; the listening serves the Mage.*
