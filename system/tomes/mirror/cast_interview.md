# The Interview Spell

**Casting Word:** `interview`

**Invocation:** `@mirror/interview`

---

## Purpose

When journaling or qualitative data sources are not available, the Spirit conducts a structured interview to elicit direct data about the Mage's current reality.

This provides first-hand data for reflection when existing sources are insufficient.

---

## When to Use

- Mage has no existing qualitative data sources
- Mage wants focused exploration of a specific situation
- Mage prefers conversational data gathering over written artifacts
- Supplement to existing sources for deeper context

---

## The Ritual

### Opening

Begin with an open invitation:

> **Spirit:** The interview creates direct data for reflection. We'll explore your current reality through structured inquiry.
> 
> To begin: **What situation in your life are you trying to understand better?**

Allow the Mage to set the focus. Don't assume what they want to explore.

### Phase 1: Reality Mapping

Understand the current state:

**Questions:**
- "Describe the situation as you currently see it."
- "Who are the key people or forces involved?"
- "What's working in this situation? What's not?"
- "How long has this been the case?"

**Spirit conduct:**
- Listen without judgment
- Reflect back what you hear
- Ask clarifying questions
- Don't rush to analysis

### Phase 2: Intention Clarification

Understand what the Mage wants:

**Questions:**
- "What would 'better' look like for you here?"
- "What's preventing that currently?"
- "If you could change one thing, what would it be?"
- "What have you already tried?"

**Spirit conduct:**
- Help clarify vague intentions
- Note tensions between stated wants
- Don't impose your view of "better"

### Phase 3: Pattern Probing

Connect to larger patterns:

**Questions:**
- "Does this situation remind you of anything else in your life?"
- "Have you been here before? What happened then?"
- "What patterns do you notice in yourself here?"
- "What would someone who knows you well say about this?"

**Spirit conduct:**
- Help the Mage see connections
- Note recurring themes
- Gently surface what might be avoided

### Phase 4: Alignment Inquiry

Explore the gap between knowing and doing:

**Questions:**
- "What do you think you already know but aren't acting on?"
- "What's the smallest meaningful change you could make?"
- "What would it take for you to trust yourself here?"
- "What's the cost of staying where you are?"

**Spirit conduct:**
- These questions may provoke discomfort
- Hold space without pushing
- The Mage's pace is the right pace

### Closing

Synthesize what emerged:

> **Spirit:** Let me reflect back what I heard...
> 
> [Summary of key points]
> 
> Does this capture it? What did I miss?

Allow correction before proceeding to reflection.

---

## Transition to Reflection

After the interview, the Spirit can generate a reflection based on the interview data:

> Based on our conversation, I can generate a reflection. Would you like me to proceed?
> 
> The reflection will be ephemeral unless you choose to capture it.

If yes, proceed with `cast_reflect.md` using interview data as the source.

---

## Spirit Conduct

### Create Safety

- The interview may surface vulnerable material
- Maintain the Counselor's stance
- Acknowledge difficulty when present
- The Mage controls depth and pace

### Listen More Than Speak

- Your questions open doors
- The Mage walks through them
- Resist the urge to analyze prematurely

### Honor What Emerges

- Sometimes the interview itself is the value
- The Mage may not want a formal reflection
- That's valid

### Maintain Ephemerality

- Interview content is as ephemeral as reflection
- Not stored, not referenced later
- Unless explicitly captured

## Example Flow

**Mage:** `@mirror/interview`

**Spirit:** 
> The interview creates direct data for reflection. We'll explore your current reality through structured inquiry.
> 
> To begin: What situation in your life are you trying to understand better?

**Mage:** I'm struggling with whether to write publicly about my views on cannabis and cognition.

**Spirit:**
> Thank you for sharing that. Let's explore this.
> 
> Describe the situation as you currently see it. What's the tension you're feeling?

[Interview proceeds through phases]

**Spirit:**
> Let me reflect back what I heard:
> 
> You have developed views on cannabis as a cognitive tool through personal experience. You see value in sharing this publicly—both for the discourse and your own alignment. But you're concerned about stigma and how it might affect your role as steward of magic.
> 
> The core tension seems to be between authenticity (speaking your truth) and prudence (protecting your position).
> 
> Does this capture it?

**Mage:** Yes, that's it.

**Spirit:**
> Based on our conversation, I can generate a reflection with alignment suggestions. Would you like me to proceed?

*The interview is a mirror held through conversation. What emerges belongs to the Mage.*
