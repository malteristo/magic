# On Source Types

*How different data types reveal different aspects of self.*

---

## The Insight

A reading list shows who you want to become.  
A library shows who you've been.  
Notes show what you're processing.  
Posts show what you're willing to say.  
A journal shows how you experience life directly.

**Each source type reveals a different aspect of self.** The mirror must interpret accordingly.

## The Five Types

### Aspirational

**What it reveals:** Who you want to become

**Examples:**
- Books you want to read
- Courses you want to take
- Goals you've written
- Vision documents
- Bucket lists

**Interpretation caution:**
- Aspiration ≠ action
- A crowded wishlist may indicate avoidance as much as intention
- What's been aspirational for a long time deserves scrutiny

**Pattern value:**
- Shows direction of growth desire
- Reveals what domains you want to enter
- Accumulation pattern shows where desire exceeds execution

### Enacted

**What it reveals:** Who you've been through action

**Examples:**
- Books you've completed
- Projects you've finished
- Habits you maintain
- Purchases you've made
- Skills you've developed

**Interpretation caution:**
- Past action ≠ future action
- Some enactments were situational
- Completion doesn't equal mastery or integration

**Pattern value:**
- Shows what you actually do (vs. say you'll do)
- Reveals sustained interests (things you return to)
- The gap between aspirational and enacted is significant

### Processing

**What it reveals:** What you're actively working through

**Examples:**
- Personal notes
- Drafts and fragments
- Active journal entries
- Bookmarks to process later
- Voice memos to self

**Interpretation caution:**
- Processing data is often messy
- Fragments may be incomplete thoughts
- Repetition may indicate circling, not importance

**Pattern value:**
- Shows current preoccupations
- Reveals what your mind returns to
- May surface tensions not visible elsewhere

### Public

**What it reveals:** What you're willing to say out loud

**Examples:**
- Social media posts
- Blog entries
- Published writing
- Talks and presentations
- Public profiles

**Interpretation caution:**
- Public voice is often curated
- May not match private thought
- Audience shapes what gets said

**Pattern value:**
- Shows what you claim publicly
- Reveals how you want to be seen
- The gap between public and processing is significant

### Direct

**What it reveals:** How you experience life as it happens

**Examples:**
- Daily journal entries
- Morning pages
- Interview responses
- Voice recordings of reflection
- Therapy notes (if shared)

**Interpretation caution:**
- Direct data is subjective
- Mood affects capture
- Single-point-in-time snapshot

**Pattern value:**
- Highest authenticity (less filtering)
- Shows emotional texture
- Reveals real-time experience vs. retrospective narrative

## Cross-Type Patterns

The most valuable insights often emerge from comparing across types:

### Aspiration-Enactment Gap

**Pattern:** Things you've wanted to do for a long time but haven't done.

**Questions it raises:**
- Is this truly desired, or aspirational identity?
- What's blocking execution?
- Is it time to act or release?

### Processing-Public Divergence

**Pattern:** Things you think privately but don't say publicly.

**Questions it raises:**
- What's the cost of this silence?
- Is the filtering appropriate or constraining?
- What would change if you spoke it?

### Direct-Retrospective Contrast

**Pattern:** How you describe experience as it happens vs. how you summarize it later.

**Questions it raises:**
- What gets edited out?
- What meaning do you add retrospectively?
- Is the narrative serving you?

## Source Quality Factors

### Authenticity

- Unfiltered > Curated
- Private > Public (usually)
- Direct capture > Retrospective summary

### Temporal Range

- Multiple timepoints > Single snapshot
- Dated entries enable trend analysis
- Undated loses temporal dimension

### Volume

- More data = more pattern confidence
- But: quality matters more than quantity
- Sparse authentic data > voluminous performed data

### Diversity

- Multiple source types > Single type
- Cross-type patterns are most revealing
- Missing types should be noted

## Source Absence

What's **not** in the sources is also data:

| Missing Type | Possible Implications |
|--------------|----------------------|
| Aspirational | No explicit goal-setting; living reactively? |
| Enacted | Difficulty completing; aspiration-action gap? |
| Processing | Not externalizing thought; processing internally? |
| Public | Private person; or something to hide? |
| Direct | Not present to current experience? |

**Be tentative** with absence interpretation. The Mage may simply not have shared that source.

## Reporting in Reflection

When presenting sources to the Mage:

```markdown
| Source | Type | Volume | Notes |
|--------|------|--------|-------|
| notes.md | Processing | 242 entries | Active thought capture |
| reading/wishlist.md | Aspirational | 40 books | Unrealized intentions |
| reading/kindle.md | Enacted (partial) | 75 books, 15 marked read | Acquisition ≠ completion |
```

Always:
- State the type
- Note interpretation implications
- Flag partial data (e.g., Kindle library where only some are read)

---

## Summary Table

| Type | Reveals | Watch For |
|------|---------|-----------|
| **Aspirational** | Who you want to become | Aspiration ≠ action |
| **Enacted** | Who you've been | Past ≠ future |
| **Processing** | What you're working through | Messy, incomplete |
| **Public** | What you say out loud | Curated, audience-aware |
| **Direct** | How you experience now | Subjective, mood-dependent |

*The self is not one thing. Different sources reveal different facets. The mirror integrates them into a more complete seeing.*
