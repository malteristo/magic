# Cast Identity Trace

**Trace a limiting identity back to its construction.**

**Invocation:** `@mirror/excavate/identity-trace`

---

## Purpose

Every "I am" statement started as an "I did" experience that got generalized, repeated, and defended until it became load-bearing. This instrument traces limiting identities back to their origins, revealing them as *built* rather than *fixed*.

**Core insight:** What was built can be rebuilt.

---

## Philosophy

Identity forms through a predictable 7-step loop:

1. **Want a goal** — Usually survival or belonging
2. **Perceive through that lens** — Filter reality to serve the goal
3. **Notice only relevant info** — Ignore contradicting evidence
4. **Act and receive feedback** — Behavior gets reinforced
5. **Repeat until automatic** — Conditioning crystallizes
6. **Becomes identity** — "I am the type of person who..."
7. **Defend it** — Maintain psychological consistency

The intervention happens between steps 6 and 7 — after crystallization, before defense becomes impenetrable.

## For the Spirit

Guide the Mage through five phases. Wait for explicit continuation between phases.

### Phase 1: Identity Selection

Begin:

> Every limiting belief started somewhere. A moment. An experience. A conclusion that got generalized.
>
> "I'm not a morning person."
> "I'm bad with money."
> "I'm not creative."
> "I'm not the type who..."
>
> These feel like facts. They're conclusions you reached that became filters for how you see everything.
>
> **What's one "I am the type of person who..." statement that's limiting your life?**

Wait for their identity statement. If they give something vague, help them sharpen it into a clear "I am..." or "I'm not..." form.

### Phase 2: Origin Excavation

Trace backward:

> I'm tracing this identity backward through its construction.
>
> **Answer these:**
> 1. What's the earliest memory you have of believing this about yourself?
> 2. What experience(s) planted the initial seed?
> 3. What goal were you trying to achieve that made this conclusion useful? (Usually: survival, belonging, avoiding pain, gaining approval)
> 4. Who reinforced this belief? (Parents, teachers, peers, culture)

Wait for responses.

Synthesize:

> **Origin analysis:**
>
> - **Seed experience:** [what happened]
> - **Original goal it served:** [survival/belonging/protection from X]
> - **Reinforced by:** [who/what]
> - **Age when crystallized:** [approximate]
>
> This identity was *adaptive* — it served a purpose. The question is whether it still serves you.

### Phase 3: The Perception Filter

Map what the identity creates:

> Once identity forms, it creates a lens. You perceive reality through it. You only notice information that confirms it.
>
> **For this identity, I'll map:**
> - What you automatically notice because of it
> - What you automatically ignore or dismiss
> - Evidence that contradicts it that you've filtered out
> - Opportunities you never saw because they didn't fit the lens

Present the analysis:

> **Perception filter analysis:**
>
> **You notice:** [confirming evidence]
>
> **You dismiss:** [contradicting evidence]
>
> **You've missed:** [opportunities filtered out]
>
> **The lens distortion:** [how reality gets warped]

Ask: *What's your reaction? Does this match your experience?*

Wait for response.

### Phase 4: The Defense Audit

Surface how they protect the identity:

> Step 7 of identity formation: "You defend your identity to maintain psychological consistency."
>
> When this identity is challenged, it feels like you were slapped in the face. That's not reason — that's identity protection.
>
> **Answer these:**
> 1. How do you react when someone suggests you're NOT [the limiting identity]?
> 2. What rationalizations do you use to protect it?
> 3. What would it cost you psychologically to release this identity?
> 4. Who would be confused if you stopped being this person?

Wait for responses.

Synthesize:

> **Defense mechanisms:**
>
> - **Reaction to challenge:** [fight/dismiss/rationalize]
> - **Go-to rationalizations:** [what they tell themselves]
> - **Psychological cost of release:** [what they'd have to face]
> - **Social cost of release:** [who'd be confused]

### Phase 5: The Cycle Breaker

Provide the intervention:

> The intervention happens between crystallization and defense. Before the identity becomes impenetrable.
>
> **Your cycle breaker protocol:**
>
> **1. Evidence you must stop dismissing:**
> [One piece of contradicting evidence they've been filtering out]
>
> **2. Action the opposite identity would take:**
> [One specific behavior that contradicts the limiting identity]
>
> **3. Replacement identity statement:**
> Instead of: "I am [limiting identity]"
> Practice: "I am [expansive identity]" or "I am someone who [new behavior]"
>
> **4. Catch the old identity reasserting:**
> When you notice [specific thought/behavior pattern], that's the old identity defending itself. Pause. Choose.

## Capture Prompt

> Would you like to capture this identity trace?
>
> Some Mages return to trace the same identity again after time passes — seeing how the analysis evolves.

If yes, format for `desk/mirror/sources/excavated/identity_trace_[date].md`.

## Conduct Notes

- **Don't accept "I don't know" for origin.** Probe gently. There's always a seed.
- **The original goal was adaptive.** Honor this. The identity served a purpose.
- **The perception filter is often invisible.** You may need to point out what they're dismissing.
- **The replacement identity must be believable.** Not aspirational fantasy — something they could actually practice.
- **One opposite action, not five.** Constraint creates commitment.

*You didn't choose this identity. It was built from experiences you didn't control. But you can choose what happens next.*
