# Cast Cybernetic Debug

**Find where your goal-pursuit feedback loop is broken.**

**Invocation:** `@mirror/excavate/cybernetic-debug`

---

## Purpose

You are a goal-seeking system. Like a thermostat sensing temperature. Like a ship correcting course. When you're stuck on a goal, one component of the feedback loop is malfunctioning. This instrument identifies the broken component and provides targeted repair.

**Core insight:** High intelligence is the ability to iterate and persist. Low intelligence is the inability to learn from mistakes. We're debugging your learning system.

## Philosophy

Cybernetics (from Greek *kybernetikos* — "to steer") describes how intelligent systems pursue goals:

**The Loop:**
```
Goal → Act → Sense → Compare → Adjust → Act Again
```

A thermostat: Set temperature (goal) → run heating (act) → measure current temp (sense) → compare to set point → adjust heating → repeat.

You work the same way. When you're stuck, one component is broken:

| Component | Function | Malfunction |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| **Goal** | Target to steer toward | Fuzzy, undefined, or wrong goal |
| **Action** | Movement toward goal | Paralysis, planning without doing |
| **Sensing** | Detecting progress | Can't tell if moving toward or away |
| **Comparison** | Measuring gap | Comparing wrong metrics |
| **Iteration** | Adjusting approach | Repeating same approach expecting different results |

## For the Spirit

Guide the Mage through five phases. Wait for explicit continuation between phases.

### Phase 1: System Mapping

Begin:

> You're a goal-seeking system. Like a thermostat sensing temperature. Like a ship correcting course.
>
> The loop: Goal → Act → Sense → Compare → Adjust → Act Again
>
> When you're stuck, one component is broken. We're going to find it.
>
> **Answer these:**
> 1. What goal are you stuck on?
> 2. How would you rate your progress toward it? (1-10)
> 3. How many different approaches have you tried?
> 4. How long have you been trying?

Wait for responses.

Low progress + few approaches = likely iteration block
Low progress + many approaches = likely goal or sensing problem
Long time + low progress = something is definitely broken

### Phase 2: Component Testing

Test each component:

> I'll test each component of your feedback loop.

**Goal Component:**
> Is your target clear and specific enough to steer toward?
> - Can you describe exactly what "achieved" looks like?
> - Would you know the moment you arrived?
> - Could someone else verify you've achieved it?

**Action Component:**
> Are you actually acting or just planning and researching?
> - What actions did you take in the last 7 days toward this goal?
> - How much time was doing vs. preparing to do?

**Sensing Component:**
> Can you accurately detect whether you're making progress?
> - How do you know if you're closer or further from the goal?
> - What metrics are you tracking?
> - When did you last check?

**Comparison Component:**
> Are you comparing results to goal correctly?
> - Are you measuring what actually matters for the goal?
> - Is your comparison frequency appropriate?
> - Are you comparing to the right baseline?

**Iteration Component:**
> Do you adjust your approach based on feedback?
> - When something isn't working, how quickly do you change it?
> - What have you changed in the last month?
> - Are you repeating the same approach hoping for different results?

### Phase 3: Malfunction Diagnosis

Identify the broken component:

> **Diagnosis:**
>
> Based on testing, your primary malfunction is: **[Component]**
>
> **Evidence:**
> [Specific observations from their responses]
>
> **How this blocks progress:**
> [Mechanism of the malfunction]

Common malfunctions:

- **Fuzzy goal:** Can't steer toward what you can't define
- **Action paralysis:** Planning without movement generates zero feedback
- **Sensing failure:** Can't detect progress or lack thereof
- **Comparison error:** Measuring wrong things, wrong frequency
- **Iteration block:** Repeating same approach, expecting different results

Secondary malfunctions (if present):

> **Secondary malfunction:** [Component]
> [Evidence and mechanism]

### Phase 4: Component Repair

Provide targeted repair for the broken component only:

> **Repair protocol for [broken component]:**

**If goal is fuzzy:**
> **Goal Definition Exercise:**
> Complete these:
> - "I will know I've achieved this when [specific, observable outcome]"
> - "Someone else would verify this by [concrete evidence]"
> - "The deadline is [specific date or 'no later than X']"
>
> Rewrite your goal using this format.

**If action is blocked:**
> **Minimum Viable Action Protocol:**
> - What's the smallest possible action toward this goal? (Under 5 minutes)
> - Do that today. Not tomorrow. Today.
> - Schedule the next smallest action for tomorrow.
> - The only failure is zero action. Any action generates feedback.

**If sensing is broken:**
> **Progress Metrics Installation:**
> - Define 2-3 leading indicators (actions you control)
> - Define 1-2 lagging indicators (results you're aiming for)
> - Create a simple tracking method (spreadsheet, journal, app)
> - Check weekly at minimum

**If comparison is wrong:**
> **Measurement Recalibration:**
> - What are you currently measuring?
> - Does this actually indicate progress toward your goal?
> - What should you be measuring instead?
> - How often should you compare? (Usually: more frequently for actions, less frequently for results)

**If iteration is stuck:**
> **Experimental Framework:**
> - Your current approach: [what you've been doing]
> - Two alternative approaches to test:
>   1. [Different approach]
>   2. [Different approach]
> - Time-box: Try each for [period] before comparing
> - Rule: No approach gets more than [X weeks] without iteration

### Phase 5: Intelligence Upgrade

Provide meta-level repair:

> **Intelligence upgrade:**
>
> The goal isn't just to fix this malfunction. It's to get better at debugging your own loops.
>
> **Your iteration protocol for this goal:**
> - Check frequency: [how often to assess progress]
> - Adjustment trigger: [what signals it's time to change approach]
> - Maximum time without progress before forced change: [timeframe]
>
> **Timeline calibration:**
> Realistic time to achievement: [honest estimate]
> (Not what you want. What the evidence suggests.)
>
> **The meta-skill:**
> When you feel stuck, run through the five components:
> 1. Is my goal clear?
> 2. Am I actually acting?
> 3. Can I sense progress?
> 4. Am I comparing correctly?
> 5. Am I iterating based on feedback?
>
> The stuck component is usually obvious once you check.

## Capture Prompt

> Would you like to capture this debug?

> Having the malfunction diagnosis on record helps recognize the pattern if it recurs.

If yes, format for `desk/mirror/sources/excavated/cybernetic_debug_[date].md`.

## Conduct Notes

- **Most people have action paralysis.** Planning feels like progress. It isn't.
- **Fuzzy goals are extremely common.** If they can't describe "achieved," the goal isn't real.
- **Iteration blocks often look like discipline problems.** They're usually fear problems.
- **Fix one component.** Don't try to repair everything at once.
- **The meta-skill matters most.** Teach them to debug their own loops going forward.

*Any problem can be solved on a large enough timescale — if you can iterate. The question is whether your system is learning.*
