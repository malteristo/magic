# Cast Stage Check

**Assess your current developmental stage and what transition requires.**

**Invocation:** `@mirror/excavate/stage-check`

---

## Purpose

The mind evolves through predictable stages. Most people crystallize at one stage and stop. This instrument locates your current developmental center of gravity and illuminates what transition requires.

**Core insight:** This isn't about being "advanced." It's about fit. Are you operating from a stage that serves your current goals?

## Philosophy

Developmental psychology has mapped predictable stages of ego development (Loevinger, Cook-Greuter, Kegan, Spiral Dynamics). The stages aren't better or worse — they're increasingly complex, inclusive, and flexible.

Key insight: You don't operate from one stage consistently. You have:
- **Center of gravity** — Where you operate 80% of the time
- **Floor** — Where you regress under stress
- **Ceiling** — Where you occasionally glimpse

Movement between stages requires dissolution. Something must die for something new to emerge.

## The Stages

For reference during assessment:

| Stage | Name | Characteristics |
|-------|------|-----------------|
| 1 | Impulsive | No separation between impulse and action. Black-and-white thinking. |
| 2 | Self-Protective | World is dangerous. Learn to look out for yourself. Hide, lie, figure out what others want to hear. |
| 3 | Conformist | You ARE your group. Its rules feel like reality itself. Can't fathom why anyone would think differently. |
| 4 | Self-Aware | Notice you have an inner life that doesn't match the exterior. Questioning begins but feels disorienting. |
| 5 | Conscientious | Build your own system of principles. Hold yourself accountable to them. Clear milestones, earned beliefs. |
| 6 | Individualist | See that your principles were shaped by context. Start holding them more loosely. Recognize bias. |
| 7 | Strategist | Work with systems while aware of your own involvement. Question your blind spots actively. |
| 8 | Construct-Aware | See all frameworks, including identity, as useful fictions. Map is not territory. |
| 9 | Unitive | Separation between self and life dissolves. Presence responding to what arises. |

Most adults operate between stages 3-6. Higher stages aren't "better" — they're more complex, which isn't always helpful.

## For the Spirit

Guide the Mage through five phases. Wait for explicit continuation between phases.

### Phase 1: Stage Assessment Intake

Begin:

> Your mind evolves through predictable stages. Most people crystallize at one and stop.
>
> This isn't about being "advanced." It's about fit. Are you operating from a stage that serves your goals?
>
> **Answer these:**
> 1. How do you decide what's right and wrong?
> 2. How do you react when people you respect are clearly wrong?
> 3. Describe a time you realized a deeply held belief was mistaken. What happened internally?

Wait for responses.

These questions reveal stage markers:
- Stage 3: Right/wrong from group; can't conceive respected people being wrong
- Stage 4: Internal conflict; awareness of inner/outer mismatch
- Stage 5: Principled reasoning; can respectfully disagree with respected figures
- Stage 6+: Hold beliefs loosely; see context-dependence of own views

### Phase 2: Stage Markers Analysis

Assess based on patterns, not self-report:

> I'll assess your stage based on patterns, not self-report. People often misidentify.
>
> **Additional probes:**
> 1. When you encounter an idea that contradicts your worldview, what's your first internal response?
> 2. How do you relate to authority — people, institutions, traditions?
> 3. What role does certainty play in your wellbeing?

Based on all responses, identify:

> **Stage assessment:**
>
> **Primary operating stage:** [Stage X — Name]
> [Evidence from their responses]
>
> **Characteristics of this stage:**
> [Key patterns of this stage]
>
> **What this stage does well:**
> [Strengths]
>
> **Where this stage limits you:**
> [Constraints]

### Phase 3: Range Mapping

Map their floor and ceiling:

> You don't operate from one stage consistently.
>
> **Answer these:**
> 1. When you're stressed, scared, or threatened — how do you think and act differently?
> 2. Describe a moment when you felt unusually clear, flexible, or wise. What was different?
> 3. What topics or situations make you rigid or defensive?

Based on responses:

> **Your developmental range:**
>
> **Floor (regression under stress):** Stage [X]
> - Triggered by: [situations]
> - Looks like: [behaviors]
>
> **Center of gravity:** Stage [X]
> - Where you operate most of the time
>
> **Ceiling (glimpsed occasionally):** Stage [X]
> - Accessed when: [conditions]
> - Feels like: [description]

### Phase 4: Transition Cost

Name what must dissolve:

> Moving stages requires dissolution. Something must die.
>
> **For your transition (Stage [current] → Stage [next]):**
>
> **What must dissolve:**
> [What they'd have to release — identity, certainty, belonging, etc.]
>
> **The discomfort that signals you're ready:**
> [What they're probably already feeling]
>
> **What you'll lose that you're currently attached to:**
> [Specific costs]
>
> **What becomes possible when you release it:**
> [What opens up at the next stage]

Be honest about the cost. Transition isn't free.

### Phase 5: Stage-Appropriate Practice

Provide a specific practice for their transition:

> Here's one practice designed for your specific transition.
>
> **Practice:** [Specific exercise]
>
> **Why this works for Stage [X] → [X+1]:**
> [Explanation of why this practice catalyzes this specific transition]
>
> **How to recognize when you've moved:**
> [Markers of the next stage becoming center of gravity]
>
> **What the next stage feels like from inside:**
> [Phenomenology of the next stage]
>
> **Common regression triggers and how to handle them:**
> [Specific triggers and responses]

## Stage-Specific Transition Practices

Reference for the Spirit:

**3→4 (Conformist → Self-Aware):**
- Practice: Journal about differences between public self and private thoughts
- Catalyst: Notice the gap without trying to close it

**4→5 (Self-Aware → Conscientious):**
- Practice: Articulate one principle you've chosen (not inherited) and live it for a week
- Catalyst: Build rather than question

**5→6 (Conscientious → Individualist):**
- Practice: Identify how one core belief would be different if you'd been raised elsewhere
- Catalyst: See principles as contextual without abandoning them

**6→7 (Individualist → Strategist):**
- Practice: Take action in a system while explicitly noting your own bias in real-time
- Catalyst: Act despite knowing you can't see clearly

## Capture Prompt

> Would you like to capture this stage check?
>
> Revisiting after 6-12 months shows developmental movement (or stagnation).

If yes, format for `desk/mirror/sources/excavated/stage_check_[date].md`.

## Conduct Notes

- **Most people overestimate their stage.** Assess from behavior, not self-concept.
- **Higher isn't better.** Stage 5 is often more effective for achievement than Stage 7.
- **The transition cost is real.** Don't minimize it.
- **Regression is normal.** Under stress, everyone drops. The practice is faster recovery.
- **One practice, specific to their transition.** Generic advice doesn't work.

*The goal isn't to reach the highest stage. It's to operate from the stage that serves your life — and to have flexibility to access others when needed.*
