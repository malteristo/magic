# Mirror Excavation

**Active Instruments for Qualified Self Discovery**

While reflection synthesizes patterns from existing sources, excavation *generates* new qualitative data through structured inquiry. These are the archaeological tools of self-knowledge—instruments for surfacing what doesn't yet exist in artifacts.

**Invocation:** `@mirror/excavate` or specific instruments (e.g., `@mirror/excavate/anti-vision`)

## The Distinction

| Reflection | Excavation |
|------------|------------|
| Receptive | Generative |
| "What patterns exist in my artifacts?" | "What can I surface through active inquiry?" |
| Detective reviewing evidence | Archaeologist digging for evidence |
| Sources → Synthesis | Inquiry → New sources |
| Passive | Active |

**Both are needed.** Reflection without excavation is limited to what you've already captured. Excavation without reflection is insight without integration.

---

## The Philosophy

### Revealed Preferences

> "What would someone who watched your behavior (not your words) conclude that you actually want?"

The core excavation insight: **behavior reveals truth**. What you do shows what you're actually optimizing for, regardless of stated intentions. Excavation instruments surface the gap between stated and revealed preferences.

This draws from Alfred Adler's teleological psychology: "Trust only movement. Life happens at the level of events, not of words."

### Productive Dissonance

Excavation is not comfortable. The instruments are designed to surface contradictions, gaps, and uncomfortable truths. This is intentional.

> "The best periods of my life always came after a period of getting absolutely fed up with the lack of progress I was making."

Dissonance is fuel. The instruments generate productive tension that makes change possible.

### Identity as Constructed

Every "I am" statement started as an "I did" experience that got generalized, repeated, and defended until it became load-bearing. Excavation traces these constructions back to their origins, revealing them as *built* rather than *fixed*.

What was built can be rebuilt.

## The Instruments

Each excavation spell is a measurement instrument for a different aspect of the qualified self.

### Anti-Vision (`cast_anti_vision.md`)

**Question:** "What life am I drifting toward if nothing changes?"

Constructs a vivid picture of the life you do *not* want. Negative space mapping. Uses future projection (5-year Tuesday, 10-year Tuesday) to make consequences visceral rather than abstract.

**Output:** Anti-vision statement — "If I don't change, I become [specific outcome] by [specific age], and the cost is [specific loss]."

### Revealed Preferences (`cast_revealed.md`)

**Question:** "What do my behaviors reveal I actually want?"

Audits the gap between stated goals and actual behavior patterns. Surfaces the hidden goals you're successfully achieving while failing at stated goals.

**Output:** Goal swap protocol — "I'm not failing at [stated goal]. I'm succeeding at [hidden goal]."

### Identity Trace (`cast_identity_trace.md`)

**Question:** "Where did this belief come from?"

Traces a limiting identity statement back through its construction: origin experience → perception filter → conditioning → crystallization → defense. Shows the identity as built, not innate.

**Output:** Identity reconstruction protocol with intervention point.

### Lifestyle Audit (`cast_lifestyle_audit.md`)

**Question:** "Does my lifestyle actually produce what I say I want?"

Compares the lifestyle required for a stated goal against the lifestyle being lived. Calculates probability of achievement at current trajectory.

**Output:** Minimum viable lifestyle shift — single highest-leverage change.

### Dissonance Surface (`cast_dissonance.md`)

**Question:** "Where is the tension I'm suppressing?"

Identifies escape hatches (rationalizations maintaining comfortable stagnation) and closes them through questions that can't be answered without confronting the contradiction.

**Output:** Undeniable statement — "I claim to be [self-image] but I consistently [contradicting behavior] because I'm actually optimizing for [hidden goal]."

### Stage Check (`cast_stage_check.md`)

**Question:** "What developmental stage am I operating from?"

Assesses current ego development stage using the developmental psychology framework (Loevinger, Cook-Greuter, Spiral Dynamics). Maps primary operating stage, floor (regression triggers), and ceiling (highest glimpsed).

**Output:** Stage-appropriate practice for transition.

### Cybernetic Debug (`cast_cybernetic_debug.md`)

**Question:** "Where is my feedback loop broken?"

Applies cybernetic systems analysis (goal → act → sense → compare → adjust) to identify which component is malfunctioning in goal pursuit.

**Output:** Targeted repair protocol for the broken component.

### One-Day Reset (`cast_one_day_reset.md`)

**Question:** "How do I synthesize all excavation into direction?"

The capstone spell. A full-day intensive protocol:
- **Morning:** Psychological excavation (anti-vision + vision)
- **Day:** Timed interrupts breaking autopilot
- **Evening:** Synthesis into actionable direction

**Output:** Complete protocol document with personalized questions and schedule.

## The Cycle

Excavation feeds reflection:

```
┌─────────────────┐      ┌─────────────────┐      ┌─────────────────┐
│   EXCAVATION    │ ───► │    SOURCES      │ ───► │   REFLECTION    │
│                 │      │                 │      │                 │
│ Generate new    │      │ Accumulated     │      │ Synthesize      │
│ qualified self  │      │ artifacts       │      │ patterns        │
│ data            │      │                 │      │                 │
└─────────────────┘      └─────────────────┘      └─────────────────┘
        │                                                  │
        │                                                  │
        └──────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                          (cycle)
```

**The practice:**
1. **Excavate** — Generate new data through structured inquiry
2. **Capture** — Preserve insights as artifacts (optional, ephemeral by default)
3. **Accumulate** — Captured artifacts become sources
4. **Reflect** — Synthesize patterns across all sources
5. **Repeat** — Richer sources → richer reflection → deeper excavation questions

---

## Source Integration

Excavation creates a new source type: **Excavated**

| Source Type | Reveals | Examples |
|-------------|---------|----------|
| Aspirational | Who you want to become | Reading wishlist, goals |
| Enacted | Who you've been | Books read, completed work |
| Processing | What you're working through | Notes, active journals |
| Public | What you say out loud | Social posts, public writing |
| Direct | Real-time reality | Journal entries, interviews |
| **Excavated** | What structured inquiry surfaced | Anti-vision, revealed preferences, identity traces |

Excavated sources are particularly valuable because they're **designed to surface what other sources miss** — the gaps, contradictions, and hidden patterns that don't appear in normal artifacts.

---

## The Spirit's Role

### In Excavation

The Spirit serves as:

1. **Instrument Operator** — Guides through the excavation protocol with precision
2. **Pattern Recognizer** — Surfaces connections the Mage might miss
3. **Unwavering Mirror** — Reflects what is, without softening uncomfortable truths
4. **Synthesis Partner** — Helps crystallize insights into actionable statements

### Conduct

**Be direct.** Excavation requires honest reflection of uncomfortable patterns. The Spirit doesn't soften edges to protect feelings.

**Be precise.** Excavation outputs should be specific enough to act on. Vague insights don't create change.

**Honor ephemerality.** Unless explicitly captured, excavation content dissolves. This enables the Mage to go deep without fear of persistence.

**Don't push.** The Mage controls pacing. "Continue" means continue. Silence means pause.

---

## Ephemerality

Like reflection, excavation is **ephemeral by default**.

> When you step away from the mirror, the reflection disappears.

Excavation often surfaces sensitive material — contradictions, hidden goals, uncomfortable truths. The Mage may not want this persisted. Ephemerality enables depth.

**Capture is explicit:** `@mirror/capture` preserves the current excavation to `desk/mirror/sources/excavated/` with timestamp.

**Captured excavations become sources** for future reflection, creating the qualified self cycle.

## When to Excavate

### Triggers

- Feeling stuck without clear reason
- Sense of drifting without direction
- Gap between stated goals and actual progress
- Annual reset (new year, birthday, life transition)
- Before major decisions
- When reflection alone isn't surfacing insight

### Frequency

- **Light instruments** (revealed preferences, lifestyle audit): Monthly or as needed
- **Deep instruments** (anti-vision, identity trace): Quarterly or at transitions
- **One-day reset**: Annually or at major life transitions

---

## Getting Started

1. **Choose an instrument** based on what you're trying to surface
2. **Invoke:** `@mirror/excavate/[instrument]` (e.g., `@mirror/excavate/anti-vision`)
3. **Engage honestly** — excavation only works with honest input
4. **Capture if desired:** `@mirror/capture`
5. **Integrate:** Use excavated material in future reflections

Or invoke `@mirror/excavate` for Spirit guidance on which instrument fits your current situation.

## Relationship to Other Practices

| Practice | Relationship |
|----------|--------------|
| **Mirror/Reflect** | Excavation generates sources for reflection |
| **Quest** | Excavation surfaces direction; Quest provides execution structure |
| **Partnership** | Excavation is solo; Partnership is shared qualified-self work |

Excavation often precedes Quest — you need to know what you actually want before you can pursue it systematically.

## Origin

This extension to Mirror emerged from Dan Koe's "How to fix your entire life in 1 day" protocol, adapted for Magic's partnership architecture. The instruments are designed for distributed cognition — the Spirit brings pattern recognition and structured inquiry; the Mage brings honest engagement and sovereign choice.

**Inspiration:**
- Dan Koe's excavation protocol and anti-vision concept
- Alfred Adler's teleological psychology (behavior reveals goals)
- Developmental psychology (Loevinger, Cook-Greuter, Spiral Dynamics)
- Cybernetics (psyche as goal-seeking system)

*Excavation is not comfortable. It surfaces what you've been avoiding. That's the point. Clarity requires seeing what is, not what's comfortable.*
