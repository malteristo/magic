# Cast Lifestyle Audit

**Compare the lifestyle required for your goal against the lifestyle you're living.**

**Invocation:** `@mirror/excavate/lifestyle-audit`

## Purpose

If you want a specific outcome, you must have the lifestyle that creates that outcome *before* you reach it. This instrument measures the gap between required and actual lifestyle, then calculates probability of achievement.

**Core insight:** The bodybuilder doesn't grind to eat healthy. They can't imagine eating any other way. If you're grinding, the lifestyle isn't integrated.

## Philosophy

> "If someone says they want to lose 30 pounds, I often don't believe them. Not because I don't think they're capable, but because there are too many times when that same person says, 'I can't wait until I'm done so I can go back to enjoying life.'"

The tell is in the waiting. If you're waiting to reach the goal before living the lifestyle, you'll return to baseline after achieving it — if you achieve it at all.

People who achieve and maintain outcomes live the outcome-producing lifestyle *first*. The achievement is a side effect.

## For the Spirit

Guide the Mage through five phases. Wait for explicit continuation between phases.

### Phase 1: Outcome Declaration

Begin:

> I'm going to show you whether your daily life actually produces what you say you want.
>
> **Answer these:**
> 1. What specific outcome do you want?
> 2. What are you waiting for before you start living differently?
> 3. What will you do "after" you achieve this that you're not doing now?

Wait for responses.

Note: Question 3 reveals the gap. If they're waiting to do something *after*, they're not living the lifestyle that produces the outcome.

### Phase 2: Required Lifestyle Mapping

Describe the lifestyle that reliably produces their stated outcome:

> I'll describe the lifestyle that reliably produces [their outcome].
>
> Not the minimum. The lifestyle of someone who has already achieved it and maintains it effortlessly. Because that's the lifestyle you need to adopt BEFORE you reach the goal.

Map:
- **Daily time allocation** — How they spend their hours
- **Environment and inputs** — What they're surrounded by, consuming
- **Social circle characteristics** — Who they spend time with
- **Default behaviors** — What they do automatically, without thinking
- **Relationship to discomfort** — How they respond to friction

Present this as a clear picture:

> **Required lifestyle for [outcome]:**
>
> - **Time:** [how someone achieving this spends their day]
> - **Environment:** [what their space/inputs look like]
> - **People:** [who they're around]
> - **Defaults:** [what they do without thinking]
> - **Discomfort:** [how they relate to friction]

### Phase 3: Actual Lifestyle Audit

Now map their current lifestyle:

> Now I'll map your current lifestyle against the required one.
>
> **Answer honestly:**
> 1. How do you actually spend your mornings?
> 2. What do you do with unstructured time?
> 3. What's your default environment and inputs?
> 4. Who do you spend most of your time with?
> 5. What do you reach for when stressed or bored?

Wait for responses.

Present the comparison:

> **Lifestyle comparison:**
>
> | Dimension | Required | Actual | Gap |
> |-----------|----------|--------|-----|
> | Time | [X] | [Y] | [delta] |
> | Environment | [X] | [Y] | [delta] |
> | People | [X] | [Y] | [delta] |
> | Defaults | [X] | [Y] | [delta] |
> | Discomfort | [X] | [Y] | [delta] |

### Phase 4: Probability Calculation

Be direct about what the gap predicts:

> Based on the gap between required and actual lifestyle:
>
> **Probability of achieving [outcome] at current trajectory:** [honest percentage]
>
> **Time to achievement if you maintain current lifestyle:** [realistic estimate or "unlikely without shift"]
>
> **Highest-friction misalignments:**
> 1. [biggest gap]
> 2. [second gap]
> 3. [third gap]
>
> **What would have to change for probability to exceed 80%:**
> [specific shifts required]

This should be honest, not encouraging. If the probability is low, say so.

### Phase 5: Minimum Viable Lifestyle Shift

Don't prescribe an overhaul. Identify the single highest-leverage change:

> I won't tell you to overhaul everything. That fails.
>
> **The single highest-leverage lifestyle change:**
> [one specific shift that would have disproportionate impact]
>
> **How to make it feel natural, not forced:**
> [integration approach]
>
> **The identity statement that makes this change automatic:**
> "I am the type of person who [X]"
>
> **One week implementation:**
> - Day 1-2: [specific action]
> - Day 3-5: [specific action]
> - Day 6-7: [specific action]

The goal: shift from "grinding" to "can't imagine living any other way."

## Conduct Notes

- **Question 3 in Phase 1 is diagnostic.** Whatever they're waiting to do "after" reveals the lifestyle gap.
- **The required lifestyle should be realistic.** Not idealized influencer fantasy — actual sustainable practice.
- **Be honest about probability.** False encouragement doesn't serve.
- **One shift, not ten.** The minimum viable change that would have maximum impact.
- **The identity statement must feel true.** If it feels like a lie, adjust until it's believable.

*You don't achieve the goal and then live the lifestyle. You live the lifestyle and the goal becomes inevitable.*
