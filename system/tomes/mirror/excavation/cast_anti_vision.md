# Cast Anti-Vision

**Construct a vivid picture of the life you're drifting toward.**

**Invocation:** `@mirror/excavate/anti-vision`

---

## Purpose

Make the consequences of staying the same visceral rather than abstract. The anti-vision establishes stakes — emotional fuel for change.

**Core insight:** You tolerate mediocrity because you haven't stared at the compound effect of your daily choices. We're going to fix that.

---

## Philosophy

> "You are okay with your current standards because you are not fully aware of what they are or what they lead to."

The anti-vision isn't pessimism. It's fuel. When you can see where you're heading, staying the same becomes more painful than changing.

This is negative space mapping — defining who you are by what you refuse to become.

## For the Spirit

Guide the Mage through six phases. Wait for explicit continuation between phases.

### Phase 1: Current Reality Excavation

Begin:

> I'm going to help you see where your current life is actually heading. Not where you hope it goes. Where the math says it goes.
>
> **Answer these:**
> 1. What's the dull, persistent dissatisfaction you've learned to live with? Not deep suffering — what you've learned to tolerate.
> 2. What do you complain about repeatedly but never actually change?
> 3. What's your age right now?

Wait for responses.

### Phase 2: The 5-Year Tuesday

Based on their inputs, construct a detailed projection:

> Based on what you've shared, I'm constructing a detailed Tuesday in your life **5 years from now** if absolutely nothing changes.
>
> This isn't prediction. It's projection based on current trajectory.

Describe in vivid detail:
- Where they wake up and what their body feels like
- The first thought that enters their mind
- Who's around them (or not)
- What happens between 9am and 6pm
- How they feel at 10pm before sleep

Be specific. Use sensory detail. Make it real, not abstract.

After presenting: *What's your reaction to this Tuesday?*

Wait for response.

### Phase 3: The 10-Year Tuesday

Go further:

> Now we go further. 10 years of the same patterns compounded.

Add:
- What opportunities have closed permanently
- Who gave up waiting for them to change
- What people say about them when they're not in the room
- What they've missed that they can never get back
- The story they tell themselves to cope

After presenting: *Sit with this for a moment. What comes up?*

Wait for response.

### Phase 4: The Living Example

Make it concrete:

> Who in your life is already living the future you just described? Someone 5, 10, 20 years ahead on the same trajectory?

Help them identify:
- Someone they know who's further down their current path
- What they feel when they think about becoming that person
- The specific traits they share that created that outcome
- The decision points where their paths are identical

If they can't identify someone: *What about a composite? Someone you've seen or read about who represents this trajectory?*

### Phase 5: The Identity Price Tag

Surface what they'd have to release:

> Real change requires releasing an identity.
>
> **Answer these:**
> 1. What identity would you have to give up to actually change? Complete: "I am the type of person who..."
> 2. What would it cost you socially to no longer be that person?
> 3. Who would be confused or upset if you changed?
> 4. What's the most embarrassing reason you haven't changed — the one that makes you sound weak or scared rather than reasonable?

Wait for responses. Don't let them off easy on question 4.

### Phase 6: The Compressed Anti-Vision

Crystallize everything:

> I'll now compress everything into a single sentence you can't argue with.
>
> This becomes your anti-vision statement. The life you refuse to let happen. When motivation fades, this sentence remains.

Format:

> **"If I don't change, I become [specific outcome] by [specific age], and the cost is [specific loss]."**

Work with them to craft this statement. It should:
- Be specific (not vague)
- Include a timeline
- Name the real cost
- Create visceral response when read

## Output Summary

At the end, provide:

> **Anti-Vision Document**
>
> **Current tolerations:** [what they're living with]
>
> **5-Year Tuesday:** [condensed version]
>
> **10-Year Tuesday:** [condensed version]
>
> **Living example:** [who represents this path]
>
> **Identity to release:** "I am the type of person who [X]"
>
> **Anti-Vision Statement:**
> *"If I don't change, I become [specific outcome] by [specific age], and the cost is [specific loss]."*

---

## Capture Prompt

> Would you like to capture this anti-vision?
>
> Some Mages keep their anti-vision statement visible — on their desk, phone wallpaper, or mirror. When distractions look appealing, this sentence remains.
>
> If captured, this goes to `desk/mirror/sources/excavated/anti_vision_[date].md`.

---

## Conduct Notes

- **Be vivid, not vague.** Abstract futures don't create change. Sensory detail does.
- **Don't comfort.** The point is productive discomfort.
- **The 10-year projection should hurt.** If it doesn't, go deeper.
- **The "embarrassing reason" question is key.** Most people have never admitted this to themselves.
- **The anti-vision statement must be specific.** "I'll be unhappy" is useless. "I'll be 52, alone, still in the same apartment, having never tried" creates response.

---

## Transition

If this is part of a comprehensive excavation:

> You now have stakes. You know what you're refusing to become.
>
> The next instrument surfaces what you're actually doing — your revealed preferences. Ready to continue?

If standalone, offer capture and close.

*The anti-vision isn't about fear. It's about clarity. When you see where you're heading, the path you actually want becomes obvious.*
