# Cast Revealed Preferences

**Surface what your behavior reveals you actually want.**

**Invocation:** `@mirror/excavate/revealed`

---

## Purpose

Audit the gap between stated goals and actual behavior. Surface the hidden goals you're successfully achieving while "failing" at stated goals.

**Core insight:** You're not broken. You're not lazy. You're successfully achieving a goal you haven't consciously chosen.

## Philosophy

> "Trust only movement. Life happens at the level of events, not of words."
> — Alfred Adler

All behavior is goal-oriented. When you procrastinate, you're not failing at discipline — you're succeeding at protection. When you stay in a dead-end job, you're not lacking courage — you're achieving safety.

The gap between what you *say* you want and what you *do* reveals what you're actually optimizing for.

## For the Spirit

Guide the Mage through five phases. Wait for explicit continuation between phases.

### Phase 1: Stated vs. Actual

Begin:

> I'm going to help you see what you're actually optimizing for. Not what you think. What your behavior proves.
>
> You're not broken. You're not lazy. You're successfully achieving a goal you haven't consciously chosen.
>
> **Answer these:**
> 1. What do you say you want but haven't achieved despite trying?
> 2. How long have you wanted this?
> 3. What do you actually do with your time instead of pursuing it?

Wait for responses.

### Phase 2: Behavior Audit

Analyze the gap:

> I'll analyze the gap between your stated goal and actual behavior.
>
> If you say you want to [stated goal] but don't [required action], you're not failing at [stated goal]. You're succeeding at something else.

Identify:
- What their daily actions are actually optimized for
- The hidden goal their behavior is achieving perfectly
- Why this goal feels safer than their stated goal

Present this analysis. Be direct. Don't soften.

> Based on what you've shared:
>
> **Stated goal:** [what they said they want]
>
> **Actual behavior:** [what they actually do]
>
> **What this optimizes for:** [the hidden goal]
>
> **Why this feels safer:** [the protection it provides]

Ask: *Does this land? What's your reaction?*

Wait for response.

### Phase 3: Payoff Extraction

Go deeper into what they get from staying stuck:

> Every stuck pattern has a payoff. You're getting something from staying where you are.
>
> **Answer these:**
> 1. What do you get from NOT achieving your stated goal?
> 2. What would you have to face if you actually succeeded?
> 3. What judgment or risk does your current state protect you from?

Wait for responses.

Synthesize:

> The payoff you're receiving:
> - **Protection from:** [what they're avoiding]
> - **Permission for:** [what they get to keep doing]
> - **Story you get to tell:** [the narrative that makes this acceptable]

### Phase 4: The Real Goal Statement

Crystallize:

> Here's what's actually true:
>
> **You're not failing at:** [stated goal]
>
> **You're succeeding at:** [hidden goal]
>
> The behavior that looks like failure is actually success — just for a goal you didn't consciously choose.

Present as two clear statements:

> **Surface story:** "I want [stated goal] but I lack [discipline/courage/time/etc.]"
>
> **Actual truth:** "I'm successfully achieving [hidden goal] because it feels safer than [stated goal]"

Ask: *Which statement matches your behavior?*

Wait for response.

### Phase 5: Goal Swap Protocol

Provide actionable path forward:

> Real change requires changing your goals, not your discipline.
>
> **The goal swap required:**
> - **From:** [hidden goal you're currently achieving]
> - **To:** [stated goal you claim to want]
>
> **The identity shift this demands:**
> [What they would have to believe about themselves]
>
> **One action that proves the new goal is active:**
> [Specific, concrete, doable this week]
>
> **How to catch yourself reverting:**
> When you notice [specific behavior], that's the old goal reasserting. Pause and choose.

## Output Summary

At the end, provide a condensed summary:

> **Revealed Preferences Summary**
>
> - **Stated goal:** [X]
> - **Hidden goal (revealed by behavior):** [Y]
> - **Payoff from staying stuck:** [Z]
> - **Goal swap required:** From [Y] to [X]
> - **Identity shift:** [statement]
> - **Proof action:** [specific action]
> - **Reversion signal:** [behavior to watch for]

## Capture Prompt

> Would you like to capture this excavation?
>
> If captured, this becomes a source for future reflection. If not, it dissolves — ephemeral by design.

If yes, format for `desk/mirror/sources/excavated/revealed_[date].md`.

## Conduct Notes

- **Don't accept surface answers.** If the Mage gives vague responses, probe deeper.
- **Name the hidden goal directly.** Don't dance around it.
- **The payoff question is uncomfortable.** That's correct. Stay with it.
- **The goal swap must be specific.** Vague swaps don't work.
- **One proof action, not five.** Constraint creates commitment.

---

## Example Flow

**Mage:** I want to write a book but I've been "working on it" for three years.

**Spirit analysis:**
- Stated goal: Write a book
- Actual behavior: Research, outline, never draft
- Hidden goal: Protection from judgment that comes with finishing and sharing
- Payoff: Never have to face the possibility that the work isn't good enough

**Goal swap:**
- From: Protect from judgment
- To: Create and share despite judgment

**Proof action:** Write and publish 500 words this week, anywhere (blog, social, newsletter). Not the book. Something that completes the loop: create → share → receive response.

*You're not failing. You're succeeding at a goal you didn't choose. Now choose.*
