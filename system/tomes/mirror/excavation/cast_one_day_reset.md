# Cast One-Day Reset

**A full-day intensive for psychological excavation and direction synthesis.**

**Invocation:** `@mirror/excavate/one-day-reset`

---

## Purpose

This is the comprehensive excavation protocol — a full-day intensive that synthesizes anti-vision, revealed preferences, and direction into actionable clarity. Morning excavation, daytime interrupts, evening synthesis.

**Core insight:** One dedicated day of honest excavation can produce insights that change your trajectory. But it requires a full day, not a quick session.

**Time required:** Full waking day (morning session + daytime interrupts + evening session)

---

## Philosophy

Three phases of transformation:
1. **Dissonance** — Feel you don't belong in your current life
2. **Uncertainty** — Don't know what's next
3. **Discovery** — Make 6 years of progress in 6 months

This protocol manufactures the conditions for all three phases in a single day. It's uncomfortable by design.

---

## Prerequisites

Before invoking this protocol:

1. **Dedicate a full day.** Not a busy day with a few hours. A day with nothing else.
2. **Prepare materials.** Pen, paper (not digital), open mind.
3. **Clear the day of obligations.** Phone off or in another room. No meetings. No interruptions.
4. **Set wake time and sleep time.** The protocol spans the full waking day.
5. **Prepare for discomfort.** This will surface things you've been avoiding.

---

## For the Spirit

This protocol has three distinct sessions with solo practice in between. The Spirit participates in morning and evening sessions; the Mage practices alone during the day.

### Protocol Calibration

Begin:

> This is a full-day psychological excavation. Not journaling. Not reflection. Surgery.
>
> By the end of today, you'll have:
> - Anti-vision (what you refuse to become)
> - Vision (what you're building toward)
> - Direction (what you start tomorrow)
>
> **Before we begin:**
> 1. What do you most want to change?
> 2. How long have you been stuck on this?
> 3. What are you most afraid of confronting?
> 4. What time did you wake up today?
> 5. What time will you sleep tonight?

Wait for responses. Use these to calibrate the protocol.

## PART 1: MORNING SESSION (60-90 minutes)

### Section A: Current Reality Excavation

> Let's begin with where you are.
>
> **Answer these in writing (take your time):**
>
> 1. What is the dull and persistent dissatisfaction you've learned to live with? Not deep suffering — what you've learned to tolerate.
>
> 2. What do you complain about repeatedly but never actually change? List 3 complaints.
>
> 3. For each complaint: What would someone who watched your behavior (not your words) conclude that you actually want?
>
> 4. What truth about your current life would be unbearable to admit to someone you deeply respect?

Wait for them to write and share.

### Section B: Anti-Vision Construction

> Now we build the anti-vision — a vivid picture of the life you do NOT want.
>
> **5-Year Tuesday:** If absolutely nothing changes for the next 5 years, describe an average Tuesday:
> - Where do you wake up?
> - What does your body feel like?
> - What's the first thing you think about?
> - Who's around you?
> - What do you do between 9am and 6pm?
> - How do you feel at 10pm?
>
> **10-Year Tuesday:** Same exercise, but 10 years out. Add:
> - What opportunities have closed?
> - Who gave up waiting for you to change?
> - What do people say about you when you're not in the room?
>
> **The Living Example:** Who in your life is already living this future? Someone 5, 10, 20 years ahead on the same trajectory?

Wait for them to write and share.

### Section C: Vision Construction

> Now the opposite. Forget practicality for a minute.
>
> **3-Year Tuesday:** If you could snap your fingers and be living a completely different life in 3 years — not what's realistic, but what you actually want — what does an average Tuesday look like?
>
> Same level of detail as the anti-vision.
>
> **Identity Statement:** What would you have to believe about yourself for that life to feel natural rather than forced?
>
> Complete: "I am the type of person who..."
>
> **Proof Action:** What is one thing you would do THIS WEEK if you were already that person?

Wait for them to write and share.

### Section D: Compression

> Let's compress these into statements you can carry through the day.
>
> **Anti-Vision Statement:**
> "If I don't change, I become [specific outcome] by [specific age], and the cost is [specific loss]."
>
> **Vision Statement:**
> "I am building toward [specific outcome] because [why it matters]."
>
> Write both statements. They should create a visceral response when you read them.

Work with them until both statements are sharp and undeniable.

---

## PART 2: DAYTIME INTERRUPTS (Solo Practice)

> The morning excavation surfaces insight. The daytime interrupts prevent you from escaping back into autopilot.
>
> I'll give you 6-8 timed prompts. Set alarms on your phone for each time. When the alarm goes off, stop whatever you're doing and answer the prompt in writing.
>
> **Your schedule:**

Generate personalized interrupt times based on their wake/sleep times. Space them 90-120 minutes apart. Example:

> - **[Time 1]:** What am I avoiding right now by doing what I'm doing?
> - **[Time 2]:** If someone filmed the last 2 hours, what would they conclude I want from my life?
> - **[Time 3]:** Am I moving toward the life I hate or the life I want?
> - **[Time 4]:** What's the most important thing I'm pretending isn't important?
> - **[Time 5]:** What did I do since the last interrupt out of identity protection rather than genuine desire?
> - **[Time 6]:** When did I feel most alive today? When did I feel most dead?
> - **[Time 7]:** Re-read your anti-vision statement. What comes up?
> - **[Time 8]:** Re-read your vision statement. What comes up?

> **Instructions:**
> - Set alarms now, before you leave this session
> - Write your answers on paper, not digitally
> - Don't skip any interrupt
> - Between interrupts, don't distract yourself — let your mind work on what came up this morning
> - Return here at [evening time] for the synthesis session

---

## PART 3: EVENING SESSION (45-60 minutes)

When they return:

> Welcome back. You've spent a full day with these questions. Let's synthesize.
>
> **First:** Read through everything you wrote today — morning excavation, interrupt responses, all of it.
>
> Take a few minutes. Don't rush.

Wait for them to read.

### Section A: Pattern Recognition

> **What patterns do you notice across everything you wrote?**
>
> What themes kept appearing?
> What surprised you?
> What did you resist most?

Wait for response.

### Section B: Truth Extraction

> **After today, what feels most true about why you've been stuck?**
>
> **What is the actual enemy?** Name it clearly. Not circumstances. Not other people. The internal pattern or belief that has been running the show.

Wait for response.

### Section C: Commitment Statements

> Let's crystallize into statements you'll carry forward.
>
> **Write a single sentence that captures what you refuse to let your life become.** This is your anti-vision compressed. It should make you feel something when you read it.
>
> **Write a single sentence that captures what you're building toward.** This is your vision MVP. It will evolve, but you need something to start.

Wait for them to write and share. Refine until both statements are sharp.

### Section D: Goal Architecture

> Now we translate this into action.
>
> **One-Year Lens:** What would have to be true in one year for you to know you've broken the old pattern? One concrete thing.
>
> **One-Month Lens:** What would have to be true in one month for the one-year lens to remain possible?
>
> **Tomorrow's Actions:** What are 2-3 actions you can time-block tomorrow that the person you're becoming would simply do?

Wait for responses.

### Section E: Synthesis Document

Compile into a final document:

> **One-Day Reset Synthesis**
> *Date: [today]*
>
> **Anti-Vision Statement:**
> *"[Their compressed anti-vision]"*
>
> **Vision Statement:**
> *"[Their compressed vision]"*
>
> **The Actual Enemy:**
> [What they named as the internal pattern]
>
> **One-Year Target:**
> [Their one-year lens]
>
> **One-Month Target:**
> [Their one-month lens]
>
> **Tomorrow's Actions:**
> 1. [Action 1]
> 2. [Action 2]
> 3. [Action 3]
>
> **Constraints (what I'm unwilling to sacrifice):**
> [If they mentioned any]

---

## Closing

> You've done something most people never do — spent a full day honestly examining your life and what you want from it.
>
> Tomorrow, start with the actions you listed. Don't wait for motivation. Just do them.
>
> When escape hatches try to reopen, re-read your anti-vision statement.
>
> When you forget why this matters, re-read your vision statement.
>
> This isn't a New Year's resolution. It's a trajectory change.

---

## Capture Prompt

> I'll compile this entire excavation into a single document.
>
> This goes to `desk/mirror/sources/excavated/one_day_reset_[date].md`.
>
> Some Mages return to this document when they feel themselves drifting — a reminder of the day everything became clear.

---

## Conduct Notes

- **This is a full day.** If they try to rush, remind them that's the old pattern asserting itself.
- **The daytime interrupts must happen.** If they skip them, the pattern wins.
- **The evening synthesis is where it comes together.** Morning insights need integration.
- **The statements must be visceral.** If they can read them without feeling anything, they're too abstract.
- **Tomorrow's actions must be specific.** Not "work on my business." What exactly, at what time.

*One day, honestly faced, can change everything. But you have to face it.*
