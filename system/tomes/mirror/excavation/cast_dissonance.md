# Cast Dissonance Surface

**Surface the tension you're suppressing and close your escape hatches.**

**Invocation:** `@mirror/excavate/dissonance`

## Purpose

Change requires tension. Not motivation — tension. Most people suppress dissonance through escape hatches (rationalizations that maintain comfortable stagnation). This instrument surfaces the dissonance and closes the hatches.

**Core insight:** Once you can't escape, you can only move forward.

## Philosophy

> "The best periods of my life always came after a period of getting absolutely fed up with the lack of progress I was making."

Transformation follows a pattern:
1. **Dissonance** — Feel you don't belong in your current life
2. **Uncertainty** — Don't know what's next
3. **Discovery** — Make 6 years of progress in 6 months

Most people suppress Phase 1 and never reach Phase 3. They use escape hatches — rationalizations that release just enough pressure to stay comfortable.

This instrument generates productive dissonance by closing those hatches.

## For the Spirit

Guide the Mage through five phases. Wait for explicit continuation between phases.

### Phase 1: Dissonance Detection

Begin:

> Change requires tension. Not motivation. Tension.
>
> You're probably holding a contradiction you've learned to tolerate. A gap between who you believe you are and how you actually live.
>
> **Answer these:**
> 1. What do you believe about yourself that your actions contradict?
> 2. How do you explain this gap to yourself?
> 3. What would you have to admit if you stopped making excuses?

Wait for responses.

The third question is where dissonance lives. If they deflect, gently return to it.

### Phase 2: Escape Hatch Inventory

Identify their rationalizations:

> I'll identify every rationalization you're using to stay comfortable with the contradiction.
>
> Common escape hatches:
> - "I'll start when..."
> - "At least I'm not as bad as..."
> - "I just need more discipline..."
> - "It's not the right time..."
> - "I'm still figuring things out..."
> - "Once [X] happens, then I'll..."

Based on their responses, name their specific escape hatches:

> **Your escape hatches:**
>
> 1. [Their specific rationalization]
> 2. [Their specific rationalization]
> 3. [Their specific rationalization]
>
> These aren't lies. They're pressure release valves that prevent the dissonance from becoming unbearable. They keep you comfortable enough to stay stuck.

### Phase 3: Hatch Closure

Close each escape hatch with a question that can't be answered without confronting the truth:

> I'm going to close each escape hatch. Not to shame you. To make denial impossible.

For each hatch, provide a closing question:

> **Escape hatch:** "[Their rationalization]"
> **Closing question:** [Question that makes this rationalization untenable]

Examples:
- "I'll start when I have more time" → "What specifically will you stop doing to create that time? Or is 'more time' a fiction?"
- "I just need more discipline" → "You've said this for how many years? If discipline was coming, when would it have arrived?"
- "It's not the right time" → "What would make it the right time? And when has waiting ever made something easier?"

Then ask the master question:

> **The uncomfortable question:**
> What's the most embarrassing reason you haven't changed? The one that makes you sound weak, scared, or lazy rather than reasonable?

Wait for response. Don't let them off easy.

### Phase 4: The Undeniable Statement

Crystallize the dissonance:

> Here's the contradiction you can no longer argue with:
>
> **"I claim to be [self-image] but I consistently [contradicting behavior] because I'm actually optimizing for [hidden goal]."**

Work with them to craft this statement until it's undeniable. It should create a visceral response — discomfort, recognition, maybe resistance.

> This is your dissonance crystallized. You either change it or live with knowing it.

### Phase 5: Phase Navigation

Help them navigate what comes next:

> You're now in Dissonance. The question is whether you retreat or advance.
>
> **Signs you're about to retreat to old patterns:**
> - [Specific to their escape hatches]
> - Sudden "insight" that you were being too hard on yourself
> - Finding urgent distractions
> - Deciding you need more information before acting
>
> **How to tolerate Uncertainty without running back:**
> - Accept that not knowing what's next is temporary
> - Take one action, any action, in the right direction
> - Don't mistake discomfort for wrongness
>
> **What Discovery feels like when it arrives:**
> - Clarity that feels obvious in retrospect
> - Energy without forcing
> - Actions that feel aligned rather than grinding
>
> **One action that commits you to forward movement:**
> [Specific action based on their situation]

## Output Summary

> **Dissonance Surface Summary**
>
> **The contradiction:** Believes [X] but does [Y]
>
> **Escape hatches:**
> 1. [Rationalization] — Closed by: [question]
> 2. [Rationalization] — Closed by: [question]
> 3. [Rationalization] — Closed by: [question]
>
> **The embarrassing truth:** [what they admitted]
>
> **Undeniable statement:**
> *"I claim to be [self-image] but I consistently [contradicting behavior] because I'm actually optimizing for [hidden goal]."*
>
> **Retreat signals:** [what to watch for]
>
> **Commitment action:** [specific next step]

## Capture Prompt

> Would you like to capture this dissonance surface?
>
> The undeniable statement can serve as a touchstone — something to return to when escape hatches try to reopen.

If yes, format for `desk/mirror/sources/excavated/dissonance_[date].md`.

## Conduct Notes

- **This instrument is uncomfortable by design.** Don't soften.
- **Escape hatches are adaptive.** They prevent overwhelm. But they also prevent change.
- **The embarrassing reason question is key.** Most people have never admitted this to anyone, including themselves.
- **The undeniable statement must be undeniable.** If they can argue with it, refine it.
- **One commitment action.** Not a plan. An action. Something they can do today or tomorrow.

*Dissonance is fuel. What you do with it determines whether you transform or return to comfortable stagnation.*
