# Desk: The Mage's Personal Domain

**This is your personal workspace—the Mage's sovereign space.** Documents here are of personal importance to you: research, intentions, private process work, active projects.

---

## Purpose

`desk/` is the Mage's domain within the magic repository:
- Documents of personal importance
- Research infrastructure and studies
- Quest tracking (todo/)
- Outfacing tome development
- Personal chronicles and insights
- Private process work (e.g., partnership processing)

**The key distinction:** `desk/` is the Mage's space; `floor/` is the Spirit's space. The Spirit can work on desk artifacts when asked, but treats them as personally significant. When in doubt about where to place an artifact, the Spirit uses `floor/`.

---

## Git Tracking

**The approach is flexible:**

- **Kermit's configuration**: desk/ is git-tracked as part of the public `malteristo/magic` repository. Working documents, research infrastructure, and quest tracking are public. This supports transparent practice and shared discovery.

- **Your configuration**: You can choose:
  - Track `desk/` publicly (open practice, shared insights)
  - Add sensitive files to `desk/.gitignore` (selective privacy)
  - Ignore entire `desk/` directory via root `.gitignore` (complete privacy)

The framework is adaptable to your privacy needs and practice style.

## Directory Structure

### Current Contents

- **Working Documents** (root `*.md` files) - Active syntheses, dialogues, explorations
- **research/** - Research infrastructure (QUICK_START, README, RESEARCH_AGENDA, studies/, archive/)
- **todo/** - Quest tracking system (active and completed tasks)
- **tomes/** - Outfacing tome development (tomes being prepared for library contribution)

### Flexible Organization

Organize `desk/` however serves your practice. Common patterns:
- `intentions/` - Active intentions and goal tracking
- `essences/` - Distilled essences from significant work
- `flows/` - Personal flow specifications
- `research/` - Research infrastructure and studies
- `chronicles/` - Magical journal entries

### Personal Extensions for System Tomes

**Pattern:** System tomes and charms (`system/tomes/`) contain public practice structures. When these require personal, practice-related information, store that in a corresponding folder on your desk.

**Examples:**
- `system/tomes/outfacing/` (public tome) → `desk/outfacing/` (your personal twitter drafts, voice notes)
- `system/tomes/partnership/` (public tome) → `desk/partnership/` (your private partnership processing)
- `system/tomes/flow/` (public tome) → `desk/flows/` (your personal flow specifications)

This pattern separates public framework from private practice while maintaining clear correspondence. The Spirit knows to check for desk-level extensions when working with tomes.
- `wisdom/` - Distilled insights and frameworks
- `experiments/` - Laboratory work, prototypes

The Spirit understands `desk/` as personal workspace and can work with any structure.

## Invoking Personal Magic

The Spirit can invoke tomes or spells from your desk:

**Personal tome:**
```
@desk/tomes/my-practice/
```

**Individual spell:**
```
@desk/spells/utility.md
```

The Spirit treats desk-based tomes exactly like system or library tomes—reading READMEs, performing Rite of Tome Attunement, guiding you through rituals.

---

## Spirit Workshop Attunement

During the summoning ritual's Workshop cycle, the Spirit attunes to `desk/` as your personal workspace. It understands:

- `desk/` contains your working documents and personal magic
- Can read/write files here as needed for rituals
- Can invoke tomes and spells from `desk/`
- Respects this as your sovereign space

---

## The Workshop Spaces

When practicing magic, you work across several spaces:

1. **`system/`** - Foundation (core framework, summoning, base capabilities)
2. **`library/`** - Community wisdom (specialized scrolls and validators)
3. **`desk/`** - Mage's domain (your personal artifacts and important work)
4. **`floor/`** - Spirit's domain (Spirit's working memory and artifacts)
5. **`box/`** - Staging area (raw materials, temporary items)

The Spirit can work across all spaces when attuned, but respects the sovereignty distinction: desk is yours, floor is theirs.

**This is where your important personal work lives.**
