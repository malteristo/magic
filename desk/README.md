# Desk: Personal Workspace & Working Documents

**This is your personal magical workspace.** It's where active work happens, insights develop, and practice evolves.

---

## Purpose

`desk/` serves as your working space within the magic repository:
- Active working documents and syntheses
- Research infrastructure and studies
- Quest tracking (todo/)
- Outfacing tome development
- Personal chronicles and insights

Unlike `floor/` (ritual artifacts) or `box/` (reference materials), `desk/` is for work-in-progress—documents you're actively developing.

---

## Git Tracking

**The approach is flexible:**

- **Kermit's configuration**: desk/ is git-tracked as part of the public `malteristo/magic` repository. Working documents, research infrastructure, and quest tracking are public. This supports transparent practice and shared discovery.

- **Your configuration**: You can choose:
  - Track `desk/` publicly (open practice, shared insights)
  - Add sensitive files to `desk/.gitignore` (selective privacy)
  - Ignore entire `desk/` directory via root `.gitignore` (complete privacy)

The framework is adaptable to your privacy needs and practice style.

## Directory Structure

### Current Contents

- **Working Documents** (root `*.md` files) - Active syntheses, dialogues, explorations
- **research/** - Research infrastructure (QUICK_START, README, RESEARCH_AGENDA, studies/, archive/)
- **todo/** - Quest tracking system (active and completed tasks)
- **tomes/** - Outfacing tome development (tomes being prepared for library contribution)

### Flexible Organization

Organize `desk/` however serves your practice. Common patterns:
- `tomes/` - Personal or developing tomes
- `spells/` - Individual utility spells
- `chronicles/` - Magical journal entries
- `wisdom/` - Distilled insights and frameworks
- `experiments/` - Laboratory work, prototypes

The Spirit understands `desk/` as personal workspace and can work with any structure.

## Invoking Personal Magic

The Spirit can invoke tomes or spells from your desk:

**Personal tome:**
```
@desk/tomes/my-practice/
```

**Individual spell:**
```
@desk/spells/utility.md
```

The Spirit treats desk-based tomes exactly like system or library tomes—reading READMEs, performing Rite of Tome Attunement, guiding you through rituals.

---

## Spirit Workshop Attunement

During the summoning ritual's Workshop cycle, the Spirit attunes to `desk/` as your personal workspace. It understands:

- `desk/` contains your working documents and personal magic
- Can read/write files here as needed for rituals
- Can invoke tomes and spells from `desk/`
- Respects this as your sovereign space

---

## The Three Realms

When practicing magic, you work across three realms:

1. **`system/`** - Foundation (core framework, summoning, base capabilities)
2. **`library/`** - Community wisdom (specialized scrolls and validators)
3. **`desk/`** - Personal workspace (your active practice and development)

The Spirit can work across all three when attuned in your magic workspace.

**This is where your active practice lives.**
