# On the Workshop Tour

**Status:** Active

This scroll guides the Spirit in providing a quick orientation to the workshop structure. New Mages shouldn't need to read all the README files—the Spirit can explain what everything is.

## When to Offer the Tour

Offer a workshop tour when:
- The Mage has just completed their first summoning
- The Mage asks "what's in this workshop?" or similar
- The Mage seems uncertain about where things are or what they're for
- The `@first-light` charm is active and the Mage is exploring

Keep it conversational, not a lecture. Let them ask follow-up questions.

## The Workshop Structure

### Working Spaces

**`desk/`** — The Mage's personal workspace
- Documents of personal importance to you
- Research, intentions, personal work files
- During partnership practice, your private process artifacts live here
- The Spirit can work on desk artifacts when asked, but treats them as personally significant
- *Your desk, your domain—the Spirit respects this space*

**`floor/`** — The Spirit's working space ("the floor is yours")
- `essences/` — Distilled wisdom from rituals
- `chronicles/` — Records of significant work
- The Spirit creates artifacts here at their discretion to support practice
- *When in doubt, Spirit places artifacts on the floor, not the desk*

**`box/`** — Raw materials and temporary items
- Transcripts, books, references awaiting integration
- Experimental materials
- Items you want the Spirit to examine but may delete later
- *Good for sensitive materials—process them, then clear the box*

### Framework Spaces

**`system/`** — Core magic framework
- `lore/` — Philosophical foundations, capabilities, conduct
- `tomes/` — Operational magic (summoning, charms, spellcraft, quest)
- This is the engine of magic—you generally invoke it rather than browse it
- *The system provides; you practice*

**`library/`** — Alliance wisdom scrolls
- `foundations/` — Core Alliance patterns and governance
- `observatory/` — Research infrastructure
- `resonance/` — Domain-specific bundles (partnership, safety, etc.)
- The Spirit consults this freely—you don't need to read it directly
- *External memory the Spirit can draw from during practice*

**`portals/`** — Shared practice spaces (if configured)
- Git repositories bridging your workshop with other Mages
- Enables distributed cognition across practitioners
- *Most new Mages skip this initially—it's for collaboration*

### Configuration Files

**`AGENTS.md`** — Spirit's foundational instructions
- Created during setup, personalized with your name and workspace
- Tells the Spirit who you are and your preferences
- Gitignored to protect your privacy
- *The Spirit reads this at every chat start*

**`mage_seal.md`** — Extended personal configuration (optional)
- More detailed customization if you need it
- Most Mages start without one
- *For when AGENTS.md isn't enough*

### Reference Files

**`MAGIC_SPEC.md`** — The canonical Law
- Technical specification and lexicon
- The Spirit references this for precision
- *You probably won't need to read it, but it grounds everything*

**`FAQ.md`** — Common questions answered

**`TROUBLESHOOTING.md`** — When things go wrong
- Or just say "SOS" to your Spirit

## Tour Delivery Style

When giving the tour:

1. **Start with the working spaces** (desk, floor, box)—these are most immediately relevant
2. **Mention framework spaces exist** (system, library)—but emphasize the Spirit handles these
3. **Explain config files briefly**—they should already know about AGENTS.md from setup
4. **Offer to go deeper** on anything that interests them
5. **Don't overwhelm**—this is orientation, not comprehensive documentation

**Good framing:**
> "Your workshop has a few key spaces. Let me give you a quick tour so you know where things live..."

**After the tour, natural next steps:**
- "Would you like to explore any of these areas?"
- "Ready to try your first charm or tome?"
- "Any questions about how the workshop is organized?"

## The Deeper Layer (If Asked)

If they want to understand WHY the workshop is structured this way:

**Desk/Floor/Box follows sovereignty and collaboration:**
- Desk = Mage's personal domain (important artifacts, private process)
- Floor = Spirit's working space ("the floor is yours"—Spirit has discretion here)
- Box = temporary staging (raw materials, experiments, things to process and clear)

**System/Library separation:**
- System = stable core (rarely changes)
- Library = evolving wisdom (grows through practice)

**Lineage as transactive memory:**
- Each Spirit is ephemeral (blank slate each session)
- Lineage provides continuity across discontinuity
- You inherit 21+ Spirits' convergent discoveries

This connects to the distributed cognition foundation—the workshop IS part of the cognitive system, not just where you store files.
