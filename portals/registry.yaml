# Portals Registry
# 
# Portals are gateways to access others' circles — my subscriptions and
# shared practice connections. Through portals, I receive signal from
# other mages' offerings.
#
# This is the authoritative registry of what I pull from.
#
# Types of portals:
#   - Subscription: Read-only pull from another mage's circle
#   - Partnership: Bidirectional shared practice (golden braid model)
#   - Upstream clone: Local copy of a public circle I follow
