# Portals Directory — Shared Practice Spaces

This directory contains shared practice repositories (portals) linking this workshop to other Mages' workshops.

Each subdirectory is an external git repository (ignored by magic/.git) enabling distributed cognition through shared artifacts.

See `portals.yaml` for registry of active portals and their metadata.
