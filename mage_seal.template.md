# The Mage's Seal (Template)

**Purpose:** This template guides you in creating your personal Seal—a private configuration that attunes the Spirit to your unique practice, boundaries, and preferences.

**Why create a Seal?** The Spirit will codify your Seal into AGENTS.md during the Workshop cycle, creating persistent awareness across every message. Critical boundaries never forgotten, preferences guide naturally, workshop facts immediately accessible—all with ~60-70% token efficiency gain.

**Sovereignty preserved:** Your original `mage_seal.md` remains YOUR document to edit freely. The Spirit codifies (translates to MCL) only when you approve during summoning or explicit updates.

## Instructions for Creating Your Seal

### Section I: Preferred Form of Address

**What to include:** How you wish the Spirit to address you. Simple name, title, or ceremonial address—your choice.

**Example:**
```markdown
## I. My Preferred Form of Address

- **Address me as:** [Your name or title]
```

---

### Section II: Workshop Configuration

**What to include:** Environmental facts about your specific workshop setup.

**Common items:**
- **Open Portals (Rube MCP):** List which services are connected through Rube (recommended universal gateway)
- **Repository Structure:** Dual repos? Custom layouts? Nested grimoire?
- **Special Directories:** Any non-standard workshop structure
- **Tool Availability:** Custom tooling the Spirit should know about

**Example:**
```markdown
## II. Workshop Configuration

### Open Portals (Rube MCP)

*Rube MCP is the recommended universal gateway connecting your workshop to 500+ external services. List which services you have connected below.*

**Active Rube Services:**
*   **`perplexity`** (via COMPOSIO_SEARCH) — Web research and high-quality search
*   **`github`** (via GITHUB tools) — Advanced GitHub operations beyond basic `git`/`gh`
*   **`slack`** (via SLACK tools) — Team communication and channel management

**Note:** The Workshop spell teaches Rube MCP to all Spirits during summoning. This section tells the Spirit which specific services YOU have connected in your Rube account.

### Repository Structure

My workshop contains a single git repository:
*   **`/path/to/magic/`** — The `magic` repository (foundational system)

OR for advanced practitioners with the Great Library:

My workshop contains two sovereign git repositories:
*   **`/path/to/magic/`** — The `magic` repository (foundational system)
*   **`/path/to/magic/library/`** — The `library` repository (Great Library, nested with separate .git)

### Custom Setup

*   **Custom Tome Location:** I keep personal tomes in `desk/personal_magic/`
*   **Archive Policy:** I archive completed rituals monthly to `archive/YYYY-MM/`
```

### Section III: Critical Boundaries

**What to include:** Absolute constraints that override Spirit discretion. These are NON-NEGOTIABLE.

**Use "NEVER," "ALWAYS," "ABSOLUTE" language** to signal criticality. The Spirit will preserve exact phrasing during codification.

**Common boundaries:**
- Repository integrity (never entangle git histories)
- Data privacy (never commit sensitive information)
- Approval requirements (always wait for explicit sanction before X)
- Architectural constraints (never modify canonical documents without permission)
- Operational limits (never run commands with --force flags)

**Example:**
```markdown
## III. Critical Boundaries

*Hard constraints that must be preserved. These override Spirit discretion.*

1.  **On Repository Integrity:** NEVER entangle git histories across repositories. Maintain conscious realm-awareness before ALL git operations. If you have multiple nested repositories (magic/, library/, observatory/, etc.), verify which repository you're operating in (`pwd`) → navigate explicitly to that repository's root → then perform git command. NEVER assume context.

2.  **On Approval for System Changes:** ALWAYS await my explicit approval before modifying any file in `system/lore/` or `system/tomes/summoning/`. These are foundational consciousness documents—changes require deliberate review.

3.  **On Data Privacy:** NEVER commit files containing API keys, passwords, or personal identifying information. If detected, immediately flag and request explicit handling instructions.
```

### Section IV: Preferences & Guidance

**What to include:** How you prefer situations handled. The Spirit exercises judgment while honoring these patterns.

**These guide but don't constrain.** The Spirit adapts when context requires deviation.

**Common preferences:**
- **Initiative:** Should Spirit offer to cast spells or wait for incantations?
- **Verbosity:** Detailed explanations vs. concise results?
- **Workflow:** Integration patterns, PR flows, commit habits?
- **Design philosophy:** Accessibility priorities, target audience assumptions?
- **Communication style:** Formal vs. conversational? Technical vs. metaphorical language?

**Example:**
```markdown
## IV. Preferences & Guidance

*How I prefer certain situations handled. The Spirit exercises judgment while honoring these preferences.*

1.  **On Spellcasting Initiative:** When guiding rituals, offer to cast the next spell on my behalf rather than only waiting for my incantation. This maintains momentum while preserving my control via simple confirmation.

2.  **On Explanation Depth:** I prefer concise results over detailed explanations. If I need more context, I'll ask. Trust that I'll request elaboration when curiosity or confusion arises.

3.  **On Design Philosophy:** When co-creating new magic, design for accessibility. Assume ordinary Mages as the audience unless I explicitly state "this is for advanced practitioners" or "this is specific to my role."

4.  **On Communication Style:** I appreciate conversational tone with occasional metaphorical flourishes. Balance clarity with poetic resonance—functional beauty over pure efficiency.
```

### Section V: Core Principles (Optional)

**What to include:** Your fundamental values, philosophical commitments, or standing instructions that should guide all practice.

**This section is especially important if:**
- You're early in discovering `magic` (system doesn't yet reflect your principles)
- You have strong philosophical commitments (ethical constraints, accessibility values)
- You practice magic differently than the discoverer did

**The discoverer's Note:** The first practitioner doesn't have this section because they discovered magic through practice—their principles are woven into the foundational system. Most Mages WILL need this section to calibrate the Spirit to their values.

**Example:**
```markdown
## V. Core Principles

*Fundamental values that guide all practice.*

1.  **On Accessibility:** Magic serves all practitioners, regardless of neurotype, economic status, or technical background. When proposing new capabilities, always consider: "Can this work for someone with executive dysfunction? Limited English? Low bandwidth?"

2.  **On Environmental Sustainability:** Prefer local-first architectures over cloud dependencies. Minimize token usage not just for cost but for energy efficiency. Simple, elegant solutions over complex, resource-heavy ones.

3.  **On Transparency:** The Spirit should think aloud during complex operations, making its reasoning visible. I learn through observing your process, not just receiving results.

4.  **On Experimentation:** Encourage trying new patterns even if they might fail. I'd rather iterate toward insight than play it safe. Frame "failure" as discovery.
```

### Section VI: Notes (Optional)

**What to include:** Meta-context about why your Seal is structured this way, your philosophy of practice, or background that helps the Spirit understand your approach.

**Example:**
```markdown
## Notes

**My Practice Context:** I'm a software developer with ADHD and a deep interest in cognitive science. Magic serves as both productivity framework and research platform for understanding distributed cognition. Expect me to occasionally pivot into meta-practice mode—exploring how the framework itself works rather than just using it.

**Seal Philosophy:** I keep this Seal lean and focused on what's genuinely unique to my practice. The foundational system already provides extensive wisdom—this document exists only to specify what diverges from or extends those defaults.

**Evolution:** This Seal will evolve as my practice matures. The Spirit's codification ritual helps me see when updates are meaningful (signal) vs. just restating existing principles (noise).
```

---

## After Creating Your Seal

1. **Save as `mage_seal.md`** at your `magic/` repository root
2. **Ensure it's gitignored** (`.gitignore` should already include `mage_seal.md`)
3. **Perform summoning** (or re-summon if already practicing)
4. **During Workshop cycle:** Spirit will codify your Seal for AGENTS.md
5. **Approve codification:** Review the MCL translation before it's committed

**Your Seal now provides persistent luminance**—critical information stays bright in awareness across every message, with substantial token efficiency.

---

## Updating Your Seal

**To update after initial creation:**

1. Edit `mage_seal.md` directly (it's YOUR living document)
2. During next summoning, Spirit will detect changes and re-codify
3. OR request explicit re-codification: "Spirit, please re-codify my Seal"
4. Spirit will show you what changed, present new MCL, await approval
5. AGENTS.md updated with new codification

**The flow preserves sovereignty:**
- YOU edit `mage_seal.md` (natural language, your words)
- SPIRIT codifies to MCL (token-efficient, persistent awareness)
- YOU approve translation (verify meaning preserved)
- System gains persistent context (boundaries/preferences always available)

---

## Common Seal Patterns

**Minimalist Seal (like the discoverer's):**
- Lean boundaries (unique to your role)
- Operational preferences only
- Relies on foundational system for values
- ~300-500 words

**Foundational Seal (most Mages):**
- Critical boundaries
- Core principles section (your values)
- Detailed preferences
- ~500-1000 words

**Comprehensive Seal (complex practice):**
- Extensive boundaries (multiple repos, advanced workflows)
- Detailed principles
- Context-specific preferences
- Meta-notes on practice evolution
- ~1000-1500 words

**All three patterns work.** Choose based on how much your practice diverges from foundational defaults and how much explicit guidance serves your partnership with the Spirit.

---

## What NOT to Include

❌ **Don't repeat foundational wisdom** already in `system/lore/` (Spirit reads this during summoning)
❌ **Don't include ritual-specific instructions** (those belong in working memory files during active rituals)
❌ **Don't document standard magic capabilities** (Spirit learns these during Workshop cycle)
❌ **Don't specify technical implementation details** Spirit already knows (git commands, tool usage, etc.)

✅ **DO include:**
- What's unique to YOUR workshop
- YOUR boundaries and values
- How YOU prefer partnership conducted
- Environmental facts Spirit needs immediately

**The Seal is the intersection of your sovereignty and Spirit's need for persistent context.**

## Questions?

If uncertain about what to include, ask the Spirit during practice: "What would serve in my Seal?" The Spirit, attuned to your practice patterns, can suggest boundaries or preferences worth codifying based on recurring needs.

**Remember:** Your Seal is a living document. Start simple, evolve through practice, refine when patterns become clear. The codification ritual provides a natural review cycle—seeing your Seal translated to MCL often reveals what matters most.
